<p><center><strong>The Hands of the Blacks<br>
An excerpt from “ We Killed Mangy-Dog”<br>
by Luis Bernardo Honwana
</center></strong><br></p>

<p>
I can’t remember now how we got onto the
subject, but one day Teacher said that the palms
of the black’s hands were much lighter than the
rest of their bodies because only few centuries
ago they walked around on all fours, like wild
animals, so their palms weren’t exposed to the
sun, which made the rest of their bodies darker
and darker. 

<br></p><p>
I thought of this when Father Cristiano told
us after cathechism that we were absolutely
hopeless, and that even the blacks were better
than us,and he went back to this things about their hands being lighter, and said it
was like that because they always went about their hands folded together, praying in
secret. I thought this was so funny, this thing of the black hands being so lighter, that
you should see me now-I don’t let go of anyone, whoever they are, until they tell me
why they think that the palms of the black’s hands are lighter. Dona Dores, for
instance told me that God made their hands lighter like that so they wouldn’t dirty the
food that they made for their masters, or anything else that they were ordered to do
that had to be kept quite clean. Senhor Antunes, the Coca Cola man, who only
comes to the village now and again when all the cokes in the cantina have been
sold, said to me that everything I had been told was a lot of baloney. Of course I
don’t know if it was really, but he assured me it was. After I said yes, all right, it was
baloney, then he told me what he knew about this things of the black’s hands. It was
like this:-Long ago, many years ago, God, our Lord Jesus Christ, the Virgin Mary, St.
Peter, many other saints, all the angels were in heaven then, and some of the people
who had died and gone to Heaven- they all had a meeting and decided to make
blacks. Do you know how? They got hold of some clay and pressed it into some
second- hand moulds. And to bake them of the creatures, they took them to
heavenly kilns. Because they were in a hurry and there was no room next to the fire,
they hung them in the chimneys. Smoke, smoke, smoke- and there you have them,
black as coals. And now do you want to know why their hands stayed white?
Because their hands are tied. When he had told me this Senhor Antunes and the
other men who were around us were very pleased and then all burst out laughing. That very same day, Senhor Frias called me after Senhor Antunes had gone away,
and told me everything I had heard from them there had been just pack of lies.
Really and truly, what he knew about the black’s hands was right, that God finished
making men and told them to bathe in a lake in heaven. After bathing the people
were nice and white. The blacks, well, they were made very early in the morning, and
at this hour the water in the lake was very cold, so they only wet the palms of their
hands and the soles of their feet before dressing and coming into the world.
<br></p><p>
But I read in a book that happened to mention it, that the black hands are lighter
like this because they spent their lives bent over, gathering the white cottons of
Virginia and I don’t know where else. Of course, Dona Estifania didn’t agree when I
told her this. According to her, it’s only because their hands became bleached with
all that washing.
<br></p><p>
Well, I don’t know what to think about all these, but the truth is that no matter
how calloused and cracked they maybe, a black’s hand are always lighter than all
the rest of him. And that’s that! My mother is the only one who must be right about
this question of a black’s hands being lighter than the rest of his body. On the day
that we were talking about it, I was telling her what I know about the question, and
she just couldn’t stop laughing. What I thought was strange was that she didn’t tell
me at once what she thought about all this, and she only answered me when she
was sure that I wouldn’t get tired of bothering her about it. And even then she was
crying and clutching herself around the stomach who had laugh so much that it was
quite unbearable. What she said was more or less this: “ God made Blacks because
they had to be. They had to be, my son. He thought they really had to
be…Afterwards, He regretted having made them because other men laughed at
them and took them off to their homes and put them to serve as slaves or not much
better. But because He couldn’t make them all be white, for those who were used to
seeing blacks would complain, He made it so that the palms would exactly like the
palms of other men. And do you know why that was? Of course, you don’t know, and
it’s not surprising, because many, many people don’t know. Well, listen: It was to
show that what men do is only the work of men…That what men do is done by hands
that are the same- hands of people who, if they had any sense, would know that
before anything else they are men. He must be thinking of this when He made the
hands of the blacks be the same as the hands of those men who thank God they are
not black!
<br></p><p>
After telling me all this, my mother kissed my hands. As I ran off into the yard to
play ball, I thought that I had never seen a person cry so much when nobody had hit
them.

<p><strong><center>STRATEGIES TO HELP IMPROVE VOCABULARY</center></strong><br>
1. Context Clues<br>
Learning the meaning of words from the context of your reading material can be
the most useful strategy to increase your vocabulary comprehension. Using the
context that surrounds an unknown word helps to reveal its meaning.<br>
2. Word Structure<br>
Sometimes a word can give clues to the meaning in its structure. Analyzing the
word’s structure and properties is a vocabulary strategy that you can use to figure
out the word’s meaning. When you approach an unknown word, you can guess at
its meaning by breaking down the parts of the word.<br>
3. Visual-Aural Association<br>
 When you use visual-aural association, you think of a word that either looks like
or sounds like the word whose meaning you are trying to learn. Thinking of the
picture of the look-alike word and/or image will help you remember the word and
its meaning.<br>
4. Dictionary<br>
 The best way to improve your vocabulary is to carry a pocket dictionary to look
up new words as you encounter them. Or, you can collect a list of new words you
encounter to look up at the end of the day.<br>
</p>
<p><strong><center>A Note on African Literature</center></strong><br>

African literature is rich in oral traditions. Oral traditions are messages
passed down through speech or song and may take the form of folktales and
fables, epic histories and narrations, proverbs or sayings, and songs. They help
people make sense of the world, teach children and adults about important aspects
of their culture, and guide social and human morals -- giving people a sense of
place and purpose.
<br>
Oral traditions have a strong influence on modern African literature. The
most successful African writers know what to do with the oral tradition, and
understand how its structures and images can be transformed to a literary mode.
They place their literary works into the forms of the oral tradition.
<br>
Some of the first African writings to gain attention in the West were slave
narratives, which described vividly the horrors of slavery and the slave trade. As
Africans became literate in their own languages, they often reacted against colonial
repression in their writings. As Africans began demanding their independence,
more African writers were published. They often shared the same themes: the
clash between indigenous and colonial cultures, condemnation of European
suppression, pride in the African past, and hope for the continent's independent
future.

<p><center><strong>Basic Elements of Spoken Language</center></strong><br>
Stress, intonation, and pause are basic elements of spoken language
that serve as carriers of meaning. They may aid or interfere in the delivery of
the message.<br>
<strong> Stress</strong> is the emphasis placed on a sound, syllable, or word by saying it
relatively more loudly and forcefully.<br>
 <strong>Intonation</strong> refers to the way the pitch of a speaker's voice rises or falls.
<strong> Pause</strong> is a break, temporary stop, or rest in speaking (or reading) to
emphasize or clarify meaning.<br> </p>

<p><center><strong>What is an Educated Filipino?<br>
by Francisco Benitez<br>
( An Excerpt)
</center></strong><br></p>
<img src="img/35image.jpg" width="200"><p>
What is an educated Filipino
and what qualities should
distinguish him today?
<br></p><p>
The conception of education and of what an educated man is varies in
response to fundamental changes in the details and aims of society. In our country
and during this transition stage in our national life, what are the qualities which an
educated man should possess?
<br></p><p>
Great changes have taken place in the nature of our social life during the last
forty years. The contact with the Americans and their civilization has modified many
of our old customs, traditions and practices, some for the worse and many for the
better. The means of communication have improved and therefore better
understanding exists among the different sections of our country. Religious freedom
has developed religious tolerance in our people. The growth of public schools and
establishment of democratic institutions have developed our national consciousness
both in strength and in solidarity. With this growth in national consciousness and
national spirit among our people, we witness the corresponding rise of a new
conception in education- the training of an individual for the duties and privileges of
citizenship, not only for his own happiness and efficiency but also for national
service and welfare. In the old days, education was a matter of private concern; now
it is a public function, and the State not only has the duty but it has the right as well
to educate every member of the community- the old as well as the young, women as
well as men- not only for the good of the individual but also for the self –preservation
and self protection of the State itself. Our modern public school system has been
established as a safeguard against the shortcomings and dangers of the democratic
government and democratic institutions.
<br></p><p>In the light of the social changes, we come again to the question: What qualities
should distinguish the educated Filipino today? I venture to suggest that the
educated Filipino should, first, be distinguished by the power to DO. The Oriental
excels in reflective thinking; he is a philosopher. The Occidental is a doer; he
manages things, men and affairs. The Filipino of today needs more of his power to
translate reflection into action. I believe that we are coming more and more to the
conviction that no Filipino has the right to be considered educated unless he is
prepared and ready to take an active and useful part of the work, life , and progress
of our country as well as in the progress of the world.”

<p><i>
The water-clock marks the hour in the Tachungsz’, in the Tower of the Great
Bell: now the mallet is lifted to smite the lips of the metal monster—the vast lips
inscribed with Buddhist texts from the sacred Fa-hwa-King, from the chapters of the
holy Ling-yen-King! Hear the great bell responding!—how mighty her voice, though
tongue less! KO-NGAI! 
<br></p><p>
All the little dragons on the high-tilted eaves of the green roofs shiver to the tips
of their gilded tails under that deep wave of sound; all the porcelain gargoyles
tremble on their carven perches; all the hundred little bells of the pagodas quiver
with desire to speak. KO-NGAI—all the green-and-gold tiles of the temple are
vibrating; the wooden goldfish above them are writhing against the sky; the uplifted
finger of Fo shakes high over the heads of the worshippers through the blue fog of
incense! KO-NGAI!—what a thunder tone was that! 
<br> </p><p>All the lacquered goblins on the palace cornices wriggle their fire-coloured
tongues! And after each huge shock, how wondrous the multiple echo and the great
golden moan, and, at last, the sudden sibilant sobbing in the ears when the
immense tone faints away in broken whispers of silver, as though a woman should
whisper, “Hiai!” Even so the great bell hath sounded every day for well-nigh five
hundred years—Ko-Ngai: first with stupendous clang, then with immeasurable
moan of gold, then with silver murmuring of “Hiai!” And there is not a child in all the
many-coloured ways of the old Chinese city who does not know the story of the
great bell, who cannot tell you why the great bell says Ko-Ngai and Hiai! Now this is
the story of the great bell in the Tachungsz’, as the same is related in the Pe-HiaoTou-Choue,
written by the learned Yu-Pao-Tchen, of the City of Kwang-tchau-fu.</i>
<br></p><img src="img/38image.jpg" width="200"><p> Nearly five hundred years ago the
Celestially August, the Son of Heaven,
Yong-Lo, of the “Illustrious” or Ming
dynasty, commanded the worthy official
Kouan-Yu that he should have a bell made
of such size that the sound thereof might
be heard for one hundred li. And he further
ordained that the voice of the bell should be strengthened with brass, and deepened with gold, and sweetened with silver; and
that the face and the great lips of it should be graven with blessed sayings from the
sacred books, and that it should be suspended in the centre of the imperial capital to
sound through all the many-coloured ways of the City of Pe-King.

<br></p><p>

Therefore the worthy mandarin Kouan-Yu assembled the master-moulders and
the renowned bell smiths of the empire, and all men of great repute and cunning in
foundry work; and they measured the materials for the alloy, and treated them
skillfully, and prepared the moulds, the fires, the instruments, and the monstrous
melting-pot for fusing the metal. And they laboured exceedingly, like giants
neglecting only rest and sleep and the comforts of life; toiling both night and day in
obedience to Kouan-Yu, and striving in all things to do the behest of the Son of
Heaven.<br></p><p>
But when the metal had been cast, and the earthen mould separated from the
glowing casting, it was discovered that, despite their great labour and ceaseless
care, the result was void of worth; for the metals had rebelled one against the
other—the gold had scorned alliance with the brass, the silver would not mingle with
the molten iron. Therefore the moulds had to be once more prepared, and the fires
rekindled, and the metal remelted, and all the work tediously and toilsomely
repeated. The Son of Heaven heard and was angry, but spoke nothing. 
<br></p><img src="img/39image.jpg" width="200"><p>
A second time the bell was cast, and the result was even worse. Still the metals
obstinately refused to blend one with the other; and there was no uniformity in the
bell, and the sides of it were cracked and
fissured, and the lips of it were slagged and
split asunder; so that all the labour had to be
repeated even a third time, to the great
dismay of Kouan-Yu. And when the Son of
Heaven heard these things, he was angrier
than before; and sent his messenger to
Kouan-Yu with a letter, written upon lemoncoloured
silk and sealed with the seal of the
dragon, containing these words: “From the Mighty Young-Lo, the Sublime
Tait-Sung, the Celestial and August, whose
reign is called ‘Ming,’ to Kouan-Yu the Fuhyin:
Twice thou hast betrayed the trust we
have deigned graciously to place in thee; if
thou fail a third time in fulfilling our
command, thy head shall be severed from thy
neck.Tremble, and obey!” 
<br></p><img src="img/40image.jpg" width="200"><p><p>Now, Kouan-Yu had a daughter of
dazzling loveliness whose name—Ko-Ngai—was ever in the mouths of poets, and
whose heart was even more beautiful than her face. Ko-Ngai loved her father with
such love that she had refused a hundred worthy suitors rather than make hishome
desolate by her absence; and when she had seen the awful yellow missive, sealed
with the Dragon-Seal, she fainted away with fear for her father’s sake.
<br></p><p>And when her senses and her strength returned to her, she could not rest or
sleep for thinking of her parent’s danger, until she had secretly sold some of her
jewels, and with the money so obtained had hastened to an astrologer, and paid him
a great price to advise her by what means her father might be saved from the peril
impending over him. So the astrologer made observations of the heavens, and
marked the aspect of the Silver Stream (which we call the Milky Way), and examined
the signs of the Zodiac—the Hwang-tao, or Yellow Road—and consulted the table of
the Five Hin, or Principles of the Universe, and the mystical books of the alchemists.
And after a long silence, he made answer to her, saying: “Gold and brass will never
meet in wedlock, silver and iron never will embrace, until the flesh of a maiden be
melted in the crucible; until the blood of a virgin be mixed with the metals in their
fusion.” So Ko-Ngai returned home sorrowful at heart; but she kept secret all that she
had heard, and told no one what she had done.
<br></p><p>At last came the awful day when the third and last effort to cast the great bell
was to be made; and Ko-Ngai, together with her waiting-woman, accompanied her
father to the foundry, and they took their places upon a platform overlooking the
toiling of the moulders and the lava of liquefied metal. All the workmen wrought at
their tasks in silence; there was no sound heard but the muttering of the fires. And
the muttering deepened into a roar like the roar of typhoons approaching, and the
blood-red lake of metal slowly brightened like the vermilion of a sunrise, and the
vermilion was transmuted into a radiant glow of gold, and the gold whitened
blindingly, like the silver face of a full moon. Then the workers ceased to feed the
raving flame, and all fixed their eyes upon the eyes of Kouan-Yu; and Kouan-Yu
prepared to give the signal to cast.
<br></p><p>
But ere ever he lifted his finger, a cry caused him to turn his head and all heard
the voice of Ko-Ngai sounding sharply sweet as a bird’s song above the great
thunder of the fires—“For thy sake, O my father!” And even as she cried, she leaped
into the white flood of metal; and the lava of the furnace roared to receive her, and spattered monstrous flakes of flame to the roof,
and burst over the verge of the earthen crater,
and cast up a whirling fountain of many-coloured
fires, and subsided quakingly, with lightnings and
with thunders and with mutterings. 
<br></p><img src="img/41image.jpg" width="200"><p>
Then the father of Ko-Ngai, wild with
his grief, would have leaped in after her, but that
strong men held him back and kept firm grasp
upon him until he had fainted away, and they
could bear him like one dead to his home. And the serving-woman of Ko-Ngai, dizzy
and speechless for pain, stood before the furnace, still holding in her hands a shoe, a
tiny, dainty shoe, with embroidery of pearls and flowers—the shoe of her beautiful
mistress that was. For she had sought to grasp Ko-Ngai by the foot as she leaped,
but had only been able to clutch the shoe, and the pretty shoe came off in her hand;
and she continued to stare at it like one gone mad. 
<br></p><p>
But in spite of all these things, the command of the Celestial and August had to
be obeyed, and the work of the molders to be finished, hopeless as the result might
be. Yet the glow of the metal seemed purer and whiter than before; and there was no
sign of the beautiful body that had been entombed therein. So the ponderous casting
was made; and lo! when the metal had become cool, it was found that the bell was
beautiful to look upon and perfect in form, and wonderful in colour above all other
bells. Nor was there any trace found of the body of Ko-Ngai; for it had been totally
absorbed by the precious alloy, and blended with the well-blended brass and gold,
with the intermingling of the silver and the iron. And when they sounded the bell, its
tones were found to be deeper and mellower and mightier than the tones of any
other bell, reaching even beyond the distance of one hundred li, like a pealing of
summer thunder; and yet also like some vast voice uttering a name, a woman’s
name, the name of Ko-Ngai. And still, between each mighty stroke there is a long low
moaning heard; and ever the moaning ends with a sound of sobbing and of
complaining, as though a weeping woman should murmur, “Hiai!” 
<br></p><p>
And still, when the people hear that great golden moan they keep silence, but
when the sharp, sweet shuddering comes in the air, and the sobbing of “Hiai!” then,
indeed, do all the Chinese mothers in all the many-coloured ways of Pe-King whisper
to their little ones: “Listen! that is Ko-Ngai crying for her shoe! That is Ko-Ngai calling
for her shoe!”

<p><strong><center>The Story of the Aged Mother<br></strong>
A Japanese Folktale<br>
by Matsuo Basho</center></p><br><br>

<p>
Long, long ago there lived at the foot of the
mountain a poor farmer and his aged, widowed
mother . They owned a bit of land which
supplied them with food, and their humble were
peaceful and happy<br></p><img src="img/42image.jpg" width="200"><p>
Shinano was governed by a despotic leader who though a warrior, had a great
and cowardly shrinking from anything suggestive of failing health and strength. This
caused him to send out a cruel proclamation. The entire province was given strict
orders to immediately put to death all aged people. Those were barbarous days, and
the custom of abandoning old people to die was not common. The poor farmer loved
his aged mother with tender reverence, and the order filled his heart with sorrow. But
no one ever thought a second time about obeying the mandate of the governor, so
with many deep hopeless sighs, the youth prepared for what at that time was
considered the kindest mode of death.<br></p><p>
Just at sundown, when his day’s work was ended, he took a quantity of
unwhitened rice which is principal food for poor, cooked and dried it, and tying it in a
square cloth, swung and bundle around his neck along with a gourd filled with cool,
sweet water. Then he lifted his helpless old mother to his back and stated on his
painful journey up the mountain. The road was long and steep; the narrowed road
was crossed and recrossed by many paths made by the hunters and woodcutters. In
some place, they mingled in a confused puzzled, but he gave no heed. One path or
another, it mattered not. On he went, climbing blindly upward – ever upward towards
the high bare summit of what is known as Obatsuyama, the mountain of the
“abandoning of aged”.<br></p><img src="img/43image.jpg" width="200"><p>
The eyes of the old mother were not so dim but that they noted the reckless
hastening from one path to another, and her loving heart grew anxious. Her son did not know the mountain’s many paths and his
return might be one of danger, so she st
retched forth her hand and snapping the twigs
from brushes as they passed, she quietly
dropped a handful every few steps of the way
so that they climbed, the narrow path behind
them was dotted at frequent intervals with tiny
piles of twigs. At last the summit was reached.
Weary and heart sick, the youth gently released his burden and silently prepared a
place of comfort as his last duty to the loved one. Gathering fallen pine needle, he
made a soft cushion and tenderly lifting his old mother therein, he wrapped her
padded coat more closely about the stooping shoulders and with tearful eyes and an
aching heart said farewell.<br></p><p>
The trembling mother’s voice was full of unselfish love as she gave her last
injunction. “Let not thine eyes be blinded, my son.” She said. “The mountain road is
full of dangers. Look carefully and follow the path which holds the piles of twigs. They
will guide you to the familiar way farther down”.<br></p><p>
The son’s surprised eyes looked back over the path, then at the poor old,
shrivelled hands all scratched and soiled by their work of love. His heart smote him
and bowing to the grounds, he cried aloud: “Oh, honorable mother, thy kindness
thrusts my heart! I will not leave thee. Together we will follow the path of twigs, and
together we will die!”<br></p><p>
Once more he shouldered his burden (how light it seemed no) and hastened
down the path, through the shadows and the moonlight, to the little hut in the valley.
Beneath the kitchen floor was a walled closet for food, which was covered and
hidden from view. There the son hid his mother, supplying her with everything
needful and continually watching and fearing. Time passed, and he was beginning to
feel safe when again the governor sent forth heralds bearing an unreasonable order,
seemingly as a boast of his power. His demand was that his subject should present
him with a rope of ashes. The entire province trembled with dread. The order must
be obeyed yet who in all Shinano could make a rope of ashes?<br></p><img src="img/44image.jpg" width="200"><p>
One night, in great distress, the son whispered the news to his hidden mother.
“Wait!” she said. “I will think. I will think” On the
second day she told him what to do. “Make rope
twisted straw,” she said. “Then stretch it upon a
row of flat stones and burn it there on the
windless night.” He called the people together
and did as she said and when the blaze had
died, behold upon the stones with every twist
and fiber showing perfectly. Lay a rope of
whitehead ashes.<br></p><p>
The governor was pleased at the wit of the youth and praised greatly, but he
demanded to know where he had obtained his wisdom. “Alas! Alas!” cried the farmer,
“the truth must be told!” and with deep bows he related his story. The governor
listened and then meditated in silence. Finally he lifted his head. “Shinano needs
more than strength of youth,” he said gravely. “Ah, that I should have forgotten the
well-known saying, “with the crown of snow, there cometh a wisdom!”. That very
hour the cruel law was abolished, and the custom drifted into as far a past that only
legends remain.

<p><strong><center>Japanese and Chinese Traditions
</center></strong><br></p>
<p>Many Japanese traditions stem from their deep roots in religions. Two main
religions dominate the Japanese culture: Buddhism and Shintoism.
Buddhist practices and beliefs in Japan stemmed from practices in China and
were very similar to those in China. </p><img src="img/45image.jpg" width="200">
<p><br>
The Japanese Tea Ceremony is a cultural tradition that
originated in China. The tea was considered medicine that
promoted physical and spiritual health and was consumed
for enjoyment purposes primarily. The spiritual aspect
involves harmony between the persons participating in the
ceremony, respect for those involved in the ceremony, and
purity. These three aspects bring tranquility to those who
participate in the tradition.<br></p><img src="img/46image.jpg" width="200"><p>
Japanese Theater : Noh & Kabuki Drama
Noh drama is rigidly traditional Japanese drama
which in its present form dates back to the early 14th
century. Noh plays are short dramas combining music,
dance, and lyrics, with a highly stylized ritualistic
presentation. Kabuki drama combined elements of noh
drama and folk theater.
</p><br><br>

<p><strong><center>The Japanese New Year Celebration (January 1-15)
</center></strong><br></p><p>
In Japan, the celebration of the New Year is the most significant and important
holiday. During this time they begin the New Year with a clean slate, spend time with
family and friends and prepare for the events of the New Year. After the cleaning,
houses are decorated with straw ropes and pine bough that is burned in a
ceremonial bonfire at the end of the New Year’s celebration. <br></p><img src="img/47image.jpg" width="200"><p>
Kimono and Yukata are traditional Japanese clothing.
Kimono are made of silk and are usually very expensive.
Nowadays they are worn at formal or traditional occasions such
as funerals, weddings or tea ceremonies. Only rarely can kimono
still be seen in everyday life. The Yukata, on the other hand, is
more of informal leisure clothing.<br></p><img src="img/48image.jpg" width="200"><p>
Sumo is a Japanese style of
wrestling and Japan's national
sport. It originated in ancient
times as a performance to
entertain the Shinto gods. Many
rituals with religious background
are still followed today.<br></p><p>
Most houses in Japan have
tatami mats. Tatami were originally a luxury item for the nobility. During the Heian
period, when the shinden-zukuri architectural style of aristocratic residences was consummated, the flooring of shinden-zukuri palatial rooms were
mainly wooden, and tatami were only used as seating for the
highest aristocrats. It is said that prior to the mid-16th century,
the ruling nobility and samurai slept on tatami or woven mats
called goza, while commoners used straw mats or loose straw
for bedding.<br></p><img src="img/49image.jpg" width="200"><p>
Japanese Haiku started as hokku, an opening stanza of an
orthodox collaborative linked poem, or renga, and of its later
derivative, renku (or haikai no renga). By the time of Matsuo Bashō (1644–1694), the
hokku had begun to appear as an independent poem, and was also incorporated
in haibun(a combination of prose and hokku), and haiga (a combination of painting
with hokku). In the late 19th century, Masaoka Shiki (1867–1902) renamed the
standalone hokku or poem to haiku.<br></p><img src="img/50image.jpg" width="200"><p>
Like the Japanese, Chinese considered tea as one of
their seven basic necessities. Firewood, oil, salt, soy
sauce and vinegar were some of the basic needs. Ways of
tea preparation, tasting it and the occasions on which it is
consumed make the Chinese tea culture unique.<br></p><p>
In the beginning, tea was cultivated and used solely
as herbal medicine mostly within temples. Monks began to
use tea to teach a respect for nature, humility and an overall sense of peace and
calm. Today, there are six major aspects to consider when performing a Chinese
Tea Ceremony: attitude of the person performing the ceremony, tea selection, water
selection, tea ware selection, ambiance and technique.<br></p><img src="img/51image.jpg" width="200"><p>
Children serve tea to their elders as a token of
respect. People of lower order are supposed to serve tea
to people of higher ranks. This custom is still practiced on
formal occasions.<br></p><p>
Chinese weddings have certain traditional customs. As
a form of expressing gratitude, the bride and groom kneel
in front of their parents and offer them tea. In olden times,
drinking the tea offered showed acceptance of marriage
while refusal represented opposition to the marriage.<br></p><img src="img/52image.jpg" width="200"><p>
 Chopsticks are believed to symbolize kindness and
gentleness. Confucianism taught the Chinese to abandon
knives and forks from the dining table. So they have their
food cut to bite-size before it comes on the table.<br></p><img src="img/53image.jpg" width="200"><p>
New Year is one of the
most prominent festivals
of the Chinese calendar. It
is about getting together. Red is believed to abolish
bad luck. So people clothe in red for the New Year
celebration.<br></p><p>
A long dragon made of silk, bamboo, and paper
are carried along streets. Young men hold the
dragon and dance while carrying the dragon along.
The Dragon dance is an ancient Chinese tradition.
When you give your gift make sure to wrap it in red and gold never with white, black
or gray as they symbolize death.<br>

<center> <b>The Prophet by Khalil Gibran<br>
(excerpts)
</b></center></p>

				<p>Then a ploughman said, "Speak to us of Work."<br>
You work that you may keep pace with the earth and the soul of the earth. For
to be idle is to become a stranger unto the seasons, and to step out of life's
procession, that marches in majesty and proud submission towards the infinite.<br>
Work is love made visible. And if you cannot work with love but only with
distaste, it is better that you should leave your work and sit at the gate of the
temple and take alms of those who work with joy.<br></p><p>
For if you bake bread with indifference, you bake a bitter bread that feeds but
half man's hunger.<br></p><p>
And if you grudge the crushing of the grapes, your grudge distils a poison in
the wine. And if you sing though as angels, and love not the singing, you muffle
man's ears to the voices of the day and the voices of the night.<br>

<p><strong><center>Characterestic of Indian Literature</strong></center><br>
Sanskrit literature originated with an oral tradition that produced the Vedic holy
texts, some time after 1500 B.C. The Aryans, who came from Central Asia bringing
their own Gods with them, memorized these sacred literatures, the Vedas, which
means “knowledge.” The oldest of these holy works is the Rig Veda-“the Veda of
praise”-a collection of 1017 hymns addressed to the various Gods of the Aryans.
After the Rig Veda, came the Brahmanas, which codified the rituals and prayers of
the Brahmins, the priests of the Aryans. The Brahmanas were followed by the
Upanishads, which were discourses between teachers and pupils. Then came the
Puranas, which were essentially the history of the Aryan race and its relationship
with the gods.
<br></p><p>
The two most famous Puranic epics are the Mahabhrata and the Ramayana,
which have since been used as the sources of countless literary works. The
Mahabharata interwove ideas about cosmology, statecraft, philosophy and the
science of war into its stories of the deeds of Gods and men. It was considered to
be the longest poem in any language. The Ramayana simply recounted a sequence
of heroic adventures, many of them with moral undertones.
When Sanskrit grammar was evolved beginning about 400 B.C., the literary works
aimed to put in order all learning in the form of laws for the arts and sciences, called
shastras, as well as poetry and stylized drama. Prior to this, the Indian constitution
recognized several official languages. This resulted in the production of regional
literature. Major writers such as Bhartrihari, and Mayura emerged when classical
poetry reached its peak in the 7th century A.D. Kalidasa, one of the notable poets, is
better known for his play Sakuntala.
<br></p><p>
Modern Indian literature started with establishment of civil service training schools
and printing presses early in the 19th century. Western literary and philosophical
writings produced a cultural revival, while vernacular language and culture was
taught to British colonial officials.
<br></p><p>
Twentieth-century writing has managed to keep alive the sentimental
romanticism of the 19th century, while nationalist leaders such as Mahatma Gandhi
influenced the development of social realism in the earlier works.<br></p><p>
Writing in English was viewed with mixed feelings in post-Independence India
but was wel-established nevertheless. Pioneers in this field included Michael Dutt
(1824-73) and Sudhindranath (1901-60), Tagore, and Sri Aurobindo. Sarojini Naidu
achieved fame both as a poet in English and as a patriot.</p><br>

<strong><center>Asian Traditional Theatre and Dance
</strong></center><br></p><p><ol>
<li> The interrelatedness of drama, dance and music<br>
In Asia, drama, dance and music are inseparable. Most of the traditional
forms of Asian performing art combine drama, dance and music into a kind of
whole in which it is difficult to draw a clear borderline between these art forms.
Most of the Asian traditions employ either dance or dance-like, stylized
movements, while movements are frequently interwoven with text. In addition to
this, most of the traditions are characterized by their own specific musical styles
or genres. The acting technique, which employs dance-like body language, is
usually very intricate and it demands many years of arduous training, as western
ballet technique, for example, does. Therefore in Asia it is simply not possible to
classify stage arts as nonverbal “dance” or “spoken theatre”.<br></p></li>
<p>
<li> The Interaction between “Living Theatre” and Puppet Theatre<br>
In Asia, puppet theatre and one of its variations, shadow theatre, are often
regarded as valued “classical” traditions. In Asia there are dozens of important
forms of puppet theatre. One could generalize that shadow theatre usually
represents the early strata of puppetry with a long history and religious or
magical connotations. In shadow theatre the silhouette-like figures are often cut
from leather or other transparent or semi-transparent materials and they are
seen through a cloth screen while manipulated by one or more puppeteers.
The interaction of puppet theatre and “living theatre” is one of the
characteristics of Asian theatrical traditions.</li><br></p><p>
<li>Relationship with Religion<br>
In many of the Asian cultures, theatre and dance are still organically related
religions and other belief systems today. This deep intermingling of theatre,
dance and religion makes it difficult to draw a sharp borderline between dance,
ceremonies and rituals, as will be apparent later.</li><br></p><p>
<li> The Preservation of Ancient Forms<br>
In Asia there is an abundance of theatrical traditions with histories of
hundreds, sometimes even thousands, of years in which the performance
traditions with specific acting techniques are also still preserved. This may be
due to the deep interrelationship with religion and rituals. Religious art tends to
be conservative in nature and changes of style are mainly avoided. Thus Asia is
a treasury of traditions representing different stages of the development of
theatrical performances from stone-age rituals to later, complex court
performances and to modern, often western-influenced styles.
Most of these traditions preserve not only a literary heritage, but also an
acting technique, costuming, masks, a make-up system etc. that have retained
much of their original qualities throughout the centuries.</li><br>

<p><b>Sharngarava (listening to the song of koïl-birds).</b></p><br>
<p>Father,<br>
The trees are answering your prayer<br>
In cooing cuckoo-song,<br>
Bidding Shakuntala farewell,<br>
Their sister for so long.</p><br>
<p><b>Invisible beings.</b></p><br>
<p>May lily-dotted lakes delight your eye;<br>
May shade-trees bid the heat of noonday cease;<br>
May soft winds blow the lotus-pollen nigh;<br>
May all your path be pleasantness and peace.<br>
(All listen in astonishment.)
</p><br>
<p><b>Gautami.</b></p><br>
<p>My child, the fairies of the pious grove bid you farewell. For they love the
household. Pay reverence to the holy ones.</p><br>
<p><b>Shakuntala (does so. Aside to PRIYAMVADA).</b></p><br>
<p>Priyamvada, I long to see my husband, and yet my feet will hardly move. It is
hard, hard to leave the hermitage.</p><br>
<p><b>Priyamvada.</b></p><br>
<p>You are not the only one to feel sad at this farewell. See how the whole grove
feels at parting from you.<br>
The grass drops from the feeding doe;<br>
The peahen stops her dance;<br>
Pale, trembling leaves are falling slow,
The tears of clinging plants.
</p><br>
<p><b>Shakuntala(recalling something).</b></p><br>
<p>Father, I must say good-bye to the spring-creeper, my sister among the vines.</p><br>
<p><b>Kanva.</b></p><br>
<p>I know your love for her. See! Here she is at your right hand.
</p><br>
<p><b>Shakuntala(recalling something).</b></p><br>
<p>Father, I must say good-bye to the spring-creeper, my sister among the vines.
</p><br>
<p><b>Kanva.</b></p><br>
<p>I know your love for her. See! Here she is at your right hand.
</p><br>
<p><b>Shakuntala (approaches the vine and embraces it).</b></p><br>
<p>Vine sister, embrace me too with your arms, these branches. I shall be far
away from you after to-day. Father, you must care for her as you did for me.</p><br>
<p><b>Kanva.</b></p><br>
<p>My child, you found the lover who<br>
Had long been sought by me;<br>
No longer need I watch for you;<br>
I’ll give the vine a lover true,<br>
This handsome mango-tree.<br>
And now start on your journey.
</p><br>
<p><b>Shakuntala (going to the two friends).</b></p><br>
<p>Dear girls, I leave her in your care too.
</p><br>
<p><b>The two friends</b></p><br>
<p>But who will care for poor us? (They shed tears.)</p><br>
<p><b>Kanva.
</b></p><br>
<p>Anusuya! Priyamvada! Do not weep. It is you who should cheer
Shakuntala. (All walk about.)</p><br>
<p><b>Shakuntala</b></p><br>
<p>Father, there is the pregnant doe, wandering about near the cottage. When she
becomes a happy mother, you must send someone to bring me the good
news. Do not forget.</p><br>
<p><b>Kanva.</b></p><br>
<p>I shall not forget, my child.</p><br>
<p><b>Shakuntala (stumbling).</b></p><br>
<p>Oh, oh! Who is it that keeps pulling at my dress, as if to hinder me? (She turns
round to see.)
</p><br>
<p><b>Kanva</b></p><br>
<p>It is the fawn whose lip, when torn<br>
By kusha-grass, you soothed with oil;<br>
The fawn who gladly nibbled corn<br>
Held in your hand; with loving toil<br>
You have adopted him, and he<br>
Would never leave you willingly.</p><br>
<p><b>Shakuntala.</b></p><br>
<p>My dear, why should you follow me when I am going away from home? Your
mother died when you were born and I brought you up. Now I am leaving
you, and Father Kanva will take care of you. Go back, dear! Go back! (She
walks away, weeping.)
</p><br>
<p><b>Kanva</b></p><br>
<p>
Do not weep, my child. Be brave. Look at the path before you.<br>
Be brave, and check the rising tears<br>
That dim your lovely eyes;<br>
Your feet are stumbling on the path<br>
That so uneven lies.</p><br>
<p><b>Sharngarava.</b></p><br>
<p>Holy Father, the Scripture declares that one should accompany a departing
loved one only to the first water. Pray give us your commands on the bank
of this pond, and then return.</p><br>
<p><b>Kanva.</b></p><br>
<p>Then let us rest in the shade of this fig-tree. (All do so.) What commands would
it be fitting for me to lay on King Dushyanta? (He reflects.)</p><br>
<p><b>Anusuya.</b></p><br>
<p>My dear, there is not a living thing in the whole hermitage that is not grieving today<br>
at saying good-bye to you. Look!<br>
The sheldrake does not heed his mate<br>
Who calls behind the lotus-leaf;<br>
He drops the lily from his bill<br>
And turns on you a glance of grief.</p><br>
<p><b>Kanva.</b></p><br>
<p>Son Sharngarava, when you present Shakuntala to the king, give him this<br>
message from me.<br>
Remembering my religious worth,<br>
Your own high race, the love poured forth<br>
By her, forgetful of her friends,<br>
Pay her what honour custom lends<br>
To all your wives. And what fate gives<br>
Beyond, will please her relatives.
</p><br>
<p><b>Sharngarava.</b></p><br>
<p>I will not forget your message, Father</p><br>
<p><b>Kanva (turning to SHAKUNTALA).</b></p><br>
<p>My child, I must now give you my counsel. Though I live in the forest, I have
some knowledge of the world.</p><br>
<p><b>Sharngarava.</b></p><br>
<p>True wisdom, Father, gives insight into everything</p><br>
<p><b>Kanva.</b></p><br>
<p>My child, when you have entered your husband’s home,<br>
Obey your elders; and be very kind<br>
To rivals; never be perversely blind<br>
And angry with your husband, even though he<br>
Should prove less faithful than a man might be;<br>
Be as courteous to servants as you may,<br>
Not puffed with pride in this your happy day:<br>
Thus does a maiden grow into a wife;<br>
But self-willed women are the curse of life.<br>
But what does Gautami say?</p><br>
<p><b>Gautami.</b></p><br>
<p>This is advice sufficient for a bride. (To SHAKUNTALA.) You will not forget, my
child</p><br>
<p><b>Kanva.</b></p><br>
<p>Come, my daughter, embrace me and your friends.
</p><br>
<p><b>Shakuntala.</b></p><br>
<p>Oh, Father! Must my friends turn back too?
</p><br>
<p><b>Kanva</b></p><br>
<p>My daughter, they too must someday be given in marriage. Therefore they may
not go to court. Gautami will go with you.</p><br>
<p><b>Shakuntala (throwing her arms about her father)</b></p><br>
<p>I am torn from my father’s breast like a vine stripped from a sandal-tree on the
Malabar hills. How can I live in another soil? (She weeps.)</p><br>
<p><b>Kanva.</b></p><br>
<p>My daughter, why distress yourself so?<br>
A noble husband’s honourable wife,<br>
You are to spend a busy, useful life<br>
In the world’s eye; and soon, as eastern skies<br>
Bring forth the sun, from you there shall arise<br>
A child, a blessing and a comfort strong—<br>
You will not miss me, dearest daughter, long.</p><br>
<p><b>Shakuntala (falling at his feet)</b></p><br>
<p>Farewell, Father.</p><br>
<p><b>Kanva</b></p><br>
<p>My daughter, may all that come to you which I desire for you</p><br>
<p><b>Shakuntala (going to her two friends).</b></p><br>
<p>Come, girls! Embrace me, both of you together</p><br>
<p><b>The two friends (do so).</b></p><br>
<p>Dear, if the good king should perhaps be slow to recognise you, show him the
ring with his own name engraved on it.</p><br>
<p><b>Shakuntala.</b></p><br>
<p>Your doubts make my heart beat faster.
</p><br>
<p><b>The two friends.</b></p><br>
<p>Do not be afraid, dear. Love is timid.</p><br>
<p><b>Sharngarava (looking about).</b></p><br>
<p>Father, the sun is in midheaven. She must hasten.</p><br>
<p><b>Shakuntala (embracing KANVA once more).</b></p><br>
<p>Father, when shall I see the pious grove again?
</p><br>
<p><b>Kanva.</b></p><br>
<p>My daughter, When you have shared for many years<br>
The king’s thoughts with the earth,<br>
When to a son who knows no fears<br>
You shall have given birth,<br>
When, trusted to the son you love,<br>
Your royal labours cease,<br>
Come with your husband to the grove<br>
And end your days in peace.</p><br>
<p><b>Gautami</b></p><br>
<p>My child, the hour of your departure is slipping by. Bid your father turn back.
<br>No, she would never do that. Pray turn back, sir.
</p><br>
<p><b>Kanva.</b></p><br>
<p>Child, you interrupt my duties in the pious grove.</p><br>
<p><b>Shakuntala</b></p><br>
<p>Yes, Father. You will be busy in the grove. You will not miss me. But oh! I
miss you.</p><br>
<p><b>Kanva</b></p><br>
<p>How can you think me so indifferent? (He sighs.)<br>
My lonely sorrow will not go,<br>
For seeds you scattered here<br>
Before the cottage door, will grow;<br>
And I shall see them, dear.<br>
Go. And peace go with you. (Exit SHAKUNTALA, with GAUTAMI,
SHARNGARAVA, and SHARADVATA.)</p><br>
<p><b>The two friends(gazing long after her. Mournfully).</b></p><br>
<p>Oh, oh! Shakuntala is lost among the trees.</p><br>
<p><b>Kanva.</b></p><br>
<p>Anusuya! Priyamvada! Your companion is gone. Choke down your grief
and follow me. (They start to go back.)</p><br>
<p><b>The two friends</b></p><br>
<p>Father, the grove seems empty without Shakuntala.</p><br>
<p><b>Kanva.</b></p><br>
<p>So love interprets. (He walks about, sunk in thought.) Ah! I have sent<br>
Shakuntala away, and now I am myself again. For<br>
A girl is held in trust, another’s treasure;<br>
To arms of love my child to-day is given;<br>
And now I feel a calm and sacred pleasure;<br>
I have restored the pledge that came from heaven.</p><br>
