<center> <b>Words of Wisdom</b></center></p><br>

					<p class="paragraph1">Damiana L. Eugenio, the mother of Philippine Folklore compiled and edited what
may very well be considered as the most comprehensive collection of proverbs in our
country. There is a limited number of works like this in existence. She spent a lifetime
collecting pieces of folk literature that reveal our ancestors' wisdom. When she gathered
proverbs from various areas in our country, she declared that our elders lived by simple,
yet very meaningful rules of righteous living. In fact, she asserted that even the
Spaniards who colonized our country noticed how proverbs formed part of the native
spirit. Spanish missionaries were found to have translated such proverbs and other oral
expressions in Spanish in order for their fellow religious people to learn our indigenous
languages. By doing so, they were able to interact with the early Filipinos their and
eventually introduce the Catholic faith.<br></p>
<p>Proverbs are brief instructive expressions that suggest a specific action,
behavior, or judgment. Referred to by some scholars as ―the wisdom of many and the
wit of one", they are commonly written in the form of short assertions or poetic two-liners
which have rhyme. It is interesting to note that people are easily struck by proverbs
when they are woven in conversations or writings. This is perhaps because they have
the power to teach people the more essential truths about life and the complexity of
living. Compared to lengthy narrations, descriptions, or argumentations, proverbs are
able to effect quickly a change in view or disposition.<br></p>
<p>In Filipino, proverbs are called salawikain or sawikain. They prescribe norms,
impart a lesson, or emphasize traditions and beliefs in a community. In the anthology of
Damiana L. Eugenio, she classified proverbs into six categorie: (1) proverbs
expressing a general attitude towards life and the laws that govern life; (2) ethical
proverbs recommending certain virtues and condemning certain vices; (3) proverbs
expressing a system of values; (4) proverbs expressing general truths and observations
about life and human nature; (5) humorous proverbs and (6) miscellaneous proverbs.
Below are examples of each category.</p><br><br>

<center><p><strong>The People of the Philippines</br>
<i>by the Philippine Tourism Promotions Board</i></strong></center>
<p>
The Filipino is basically of Malay stock with a sprinkling of Chinese, American,
Spanish and Arab blood. The Philippines has a population of 70 million, and it is hard to
distinguish accurately the lines between stocks. From a long history of Western colonial
rule, interspersed with the visits of merchants and traders evolved a people of a unique
blend of east and west, both in appearance and culture.
<br></p>
<p>
The Filipino character is actually a little bit of all the cultures put together. The
bayanihan or spirit of kinship and camaraderie that Filipinos are famous for is said to be
taken from Malay forefathers. The close family relations are said to have been inherited
from the Chinese. The piousness comes from the Spaniards who introduced Christianity
in the 16th century. Hospitality is a common denominator in the Filipino character and
this is what distinguishes the Filipino. Filipinos are probably one of the few, if not the only, English-proficient Oriental people today. Pilipino is the official national language,
with English considered as the country's unofficial one.
<br></p><p> The Filipinos are divided geographically and culturally into regions, and each
regional group is recognizable by distinct traits and dialects – the sturdy and frugal
llocanos of the north, the industrious Tagalogs of the central plains, the carefree
Visayans from the central islands and the colorful tribesmen and religious Moslems of
Mindanao. Tribal communities can be found scattered across the archipelago. The
Philippines has more than 111 dialects spoken, owing to the subdivisions of these basic
regional and cultural groups.
<br></p><p> Some 80 percent of the population is Catholic, Spain's lasting legacy. About 15
percent is Moslem and these people can be found basically in Mindanao. The rest of the
population is made up mostly of smaller Christian denominations and Buddhist.
<br></p>

<p>The country is marked by a true blend of cultures; truly in the Philippines, East
meets West. The background of the people is Indonesian and Malay. There are
Chinese and Spanish elements as well. The history of American rule and contact with
merchants and traders culminated in a unique blend of East and West, both in the
appearance and culture of the people of the Filipinos, or people of the Philippines.

<center><p><strong>The Origin of This World (Maranao) </br></strong><i>from the Anthology of Philippine Myths by Damiana L. Eugenio</i></center>
<p>According to Maranaw folklore, this world was created by a great Being. It is not
known, however, who exactly is this great Being. Or how many days it took him to
create this world.
<br></p>
<p>This world is divided into seven layers.
The earth has also seven layers. Each layer is
inhabited by a different kind of being. The
uppermost layer, for example, is the place we
are inhabiting. The second layer is being
inhabited by dwarfs. These dwarfs are short,
plump, and long-haired. They are locally known
as Karibanga. The Karibanga are said to
possess magical powers. They are usually
invisible to the human eye. The third layer of the earth which is found under the sea or
lake is inhabited by nymphs. These nymphs also possess certain magical powers. It is
stated in the story of Rajah Indarapatra that he met and fell in love with the princessnymph
with whom he had a child.<img src="img/1image.jpg" width="500">
<br></p><p> The sky also consists of seven layers. Each layer has a door which is guarded
day and night by huge mythical birds called garoda. The seventh layer of the sky is the
seat of heaven which is also divided into seven layers. Every layer in the sky is
inhabited by angels. Maranaws believe that angels do not need food. They all possess
wings with which they fly.
<br></p><p> Heaven which is found on the seventh layer of the sky is where good people‘s
spirits go after death. Saints are assigned to the seventh layer while persons who
―barely made it‖ are confined to the lower most layer which is found at the bottom of
heaven.<br></p><img src="img/2image.jpg" width="200">

<p>
It is in heaven where we find the tree-of-life. On
each leaf of the tree-of-life is written the name of every
person living on earth. As soon as a leaf ripens or dries
and falls, the person whose name it carries also dies.

<br></p><p>
The soul of every person is found in tightly
covered jars kept in one section of heaven. This
particular section of heaven is closely guarded by a
monster with a thousand eyes, named Walo. Walo, in
addition to his thousand eyes, has also eight hairy
heads. The epic Darangan speaks of Madale,
Bantugan‘s brother and, Mabaning, Husband of
Lawanen, entering this section and retrieving the soul
of Bantugan.

<center> <b>How the World Was Created (Panayan)</b></center></p>

				<p>One of the stories about the creation of the world, which the old folks of Panay,
especially those living near the mountain, do not tire relating, tells us that in the
beginning there was no heaven or earth—only a bottomless deep and a world of mist.
Everything was shapeless and formless—the earth, the sky, the sea, and the air were
almost all mixed up.<br></p><p>
Then from the depth of this formless void, there
appeared two gods, —Tungkung Langit and Alunsina. Just
where the two deities came from it was not known. However,
it is related that Tungkung Langit fell in love with Alunsina
and, after so many years of courtship, they got married and
had their abode in the highest realm of the eternal space
where the water was constantly warm and the breeze was
forever cool. It was in this place where order and regularity
first took place.</p><img src="img/3image.jpg" width="200"><p><br>
Tungkung Langit was an industrious, loving, and kind
god whose chief concern was how to impose order over the
whole confused set-up of things. He assumed responsibility for the regular cosmic
movement. On the other hand, Alunsina was a lazy, jealous, and selfish goddess whose
only work was to sit by the window of their heavenly home, and amuse herself with her
pointless thoughts. Sometimes, she would go down from the house, sit down by a pool
near their doorstep and comb her long, jet-black hair all day long.
<br></p><p>
One day Tungkung Langit told his wife that he would be away from home for
sometime to put an end to the chaotic disturbances in the flow of time and in the
position of things. The jealous Alunsina, however, sent the sea breeze to spy on
Tungkung Langit. This made the latter very angry upon knowing about it.
<br></p><p>
Immediately after his return from the trip, he called this act to her attention
saying that it was ungodly of her to be jealous, there being no other creature living in the
world except the two of them. This reproach was resented by Alunsina, and a quarrel
between them followed.
<br></p><p>
Tungkung Langit lost his temper. In this rage, he divested his wife of powers and
drove her away. No one knew where Alunsina went; she merely disappeared.
7Several days after Alunsina left, however, Tungkung Langit felt very lonely. He
realized what he had done. Somehow, it was too late even to be sorry about the whole
matter. The whole place once vibrant with Alunsina‘s sweet voice, suddenly became
cold and desolate. In the morning, when he woke up he would find himself alone and in
the afternoon when he came home, he would feel the same loneliness creeping deep in
his heart because there was no one to meet him at the doorstep or soothe the aching
muscles of his arms.
<br></p><p>
For months, Tungkung Langit lived in utter desolation. He could not find
Alunsina, try hard as he would. And so, in his desperation, he decided to do something
in order to forget his sorrows. For months and months he thought. His mind seemed
pointless, his heart, weary, and sick. But he must have to do something about his
loneliness.
9One day, while he was sailing across the regions of the clouds, a thought came
to him. He would make a big basin of water below the sky so that he can see the image
of his wife, if she were just somewhere in the regions above. And lo! The sea appeared.
However, Alunsina was never seen.</p><p>
<br>After a long time, the somber sight of the lonely sea irritated Tungkung Langit.
So he came down to the Middleworld and created the land; then he planted this with
grasses, trees, and flowers. He took his wife‘s treasured jewels and scattered them in
the sky, hoping that when Alunsina would see them she might be induced to return
home. The goddess‘ necklace became the stars, her comb the moon, and her crown the
sun. However, despite all these Alunsina did not come back.</p><p>
<br>And up to this time, the folks in Panay say that Tungkung Langit is alone in his
palace in the skies. Sometimes, he would cry out of his pent-up emotions and his tears
would fall down upon the earth. The people say that rain is Tungkung Langit‘s tears and
that is why in some localities in the island of Panay, the first rain in May is received with
much rejoicing and sacrifice. Incidentally, when it thunders hard, the old folks also say
that it is Tungkung Langit sobbing, calling for his beloved Alunsina to come back –
entreating her so hard that his voice thunders across the fields and countryside.

<center> <i>How does this myth explain the creation of the world and the root of evil?</i><b><br>Samal Genesis</b></center></p>

				<p>In the beginning, when there were no creatures yet, there was only the
sea. Floating on this sea was a thing resembling a ball. This was the abode of
God the Most High. When he wanted to bring out his creations, the ball split;
one half of it rose and became heaven (with seven levels) and the lower half
remained and became the earth (with seven levels). Now the sea on which
the ball was floating was called Baharun Nur [Bahar, great waters, mighty
rivers; Nur, light], meaning, this was the ancestor of all which floated on it.
Symbolically, the part which was lifted up was the father, and the grandfather
was the sea on which it floated. Now at the same time of the splitting of the
ball, and as God willed it, all men and all the creatures on earth have already
been believed as being in it. <br><img src="img/4image.jpg" width="200"></p><br>
<p><i>Pre-Existent Soul</i></p>
<br>
<p>
From the time of our ancestors up to the present, the original content of that thing is what we
have been looking for. <br></p><p>
From the time of our ancestors up to the present, the original content of that thing is what we
have been looking for. 

<br></p><p>
And Nur Muhammad [technical term for the pre-existence of the soul of the Prophet] was then
already risen. When Allah the Most High was already in the highest heaven, he willed and his radiance
scattered and became a man---Nur Muhammad. Now, when the latter became aware of himself, he
asserted that he was God. Looking left and right, he saw that he was alone. So he said to himself,
―There is nobody but me, so I must be God.‖ He then went around, and after walking some distance he said, ―Arastum Murabbikum,‖ meaning, ―I am God.‖ Then all of a sudden, a voice answered, ―Kahal
Bala,” and Nur disintegrated. 
<br></p><p>
When Nur disintegrated, all the elements contained in the earth and the heavens were drawn out
of him. All creatures then appeared. From the single light [Nur] was taken the elements that became
the moon, the sun, the stars, the trees, and all living things. They were all there. And this was begun
on a Sunday and was completed on a Friday.
<br><br></p><p>
Why God is Hidden
<br></p><p>
After all things had been drawn out of Nur Muhammad, he was made man once again, and God
said to him, ―Don‘t assert that you are God. It is I. But if you don't believe, let us play hide and seek.
You hide and I will look for you. Then I will hide and you will look for me. If I can find you and you
cannot find me, then surely I am God.‖ And so they commenced the trial. No matter how hard Nur
Muhammad hid, God always pinpointed him. Then God said, ―Now I will hide.‖ And Nur Muhammad
could not find him. [This is said to be the reason why we cannot see God.]
<br></p><p>
God then summoned the angel, Jibra'il [Gabriel]. God then said to him, ―Go on to earth and get a
handful of soil.‖ When Jibra‘il descended and tried to pick up some earth. The earth cursed and
refused to be taken, Jibra‘il returned empty-handed, and God said to another angel, Mika‘il, ―You go.‖
When Mikail reached the earth, the same refusal met him. Then the angel, Israfil, took his turn, but the
earth likewise refused. Then the fourth angel, Idjara‘il [Izra‘il or Azra‘el], immediately went down and
forthwith grabbed the earth. One of his fingers was on the west, another on the east, a third one on the
south, and a fourth one on the earth. And he scooped a handful.
<br></p><p>
 Then God said to Jibra‘il, ―Make it into a man.‖ When it had assumed the form of a man, Jibra‘il
said, ―My Lord, the man is here, but it cannot speak, and his joints are no t connected.‖
<br></p><img src="img/5image.jpg" width="200"><p>Then God said, ―Get a ganta of rice and grind it into
powder and apply it to him.‖ Then the joints were connected and the man
became whole, but he still could not speak. Then God commanded Nur
Muhammad, ―Go inside Adam‖ (for that was the name of the man). But
Nur Muhammad said, ―I refuse. You created Adam from the four elements
(fire, water, wind, and earth), whereas I came from Your light.‖ Then God
said to Nur Muhammad, ―Be willing, for you and I are one, and you can
meet me five times a day during prayer.‖ So Nur Muhammad went inside
Adam through his forehead and Adam became a living man.
<br></p><p> And God made Adam into a Caliph and commanded all creatures including angels to pay
homage to him. And every creature did, except Iblis (the Evil One) who said to God, ―How can I
worship Adam seeing he was created of four elements whereas I have served you for hundreds of
years.‖ In spite of God‘s entreaty, Iblis continued to refuse. Then, Iblis asked God to grant him four
wishes. First, that he would be the richest of all; second, that he would be the most exalted of all; third,
that he can steal the riches of those who have; and fourth, that those riches he cannot steal, he kills.
And this is the origin of the evil desire for material goods and for worldly fame which leads to envy and
killing. Those whom Iblis enters are led to evil. For he had an agreement with God that those he can
mislead are his and those he cannot are God‘s.

<img src="img/6image.jpg" width="200"><i><p>The Municipality of Samal derived its
name from the Isamals who were its first
inhabitants. The Isamals were brought by
the first and second waves of migration
from the Malay Region of Southeast
Asia, dynastically ruled by a Datu up to
the early part of the American Regime.
The latest ruling tribal Chieftain was Datu
Taganiog who died on January 28, 1948.
Discovery revealed that the latter lived at "Malibasa" (now known as
Peñaplata, the poblacion) where he exercised his general supervision.
The word "Malibasa" meant honorable. The Isamals lived in perfect
harmony as peace-loving people.
</p></i>
<i><p>Generally, Samal Municipality is characterized by uneven
distribution of lowlands, wide expanse of mountain ranges and few
isolated hills. Tayapoc, renowned for its "Puting Bato" or White Stone is
Samal range's highest peak towering at 162 meters above the sea level.
The Sopsopon Plateau lies on its top with an approximate area of 400
hectares.
</p><br>
<p>A number of waterways can also be found in the municipality,
though none of them is navigable. The Hagimit Falls which is
approximately 15 feet high, the Binoling River and several other natural
springs, namely: Supa, Alibungog, Tagbitinao, Tagbitan-ag, Aundanao,
Licup, San Jose and Tagdaliao Springs are among the few popular sites
found in the island.
</p><br>
<p>The historical traces of the name of this developing island town
came to surface from information gathered through investigations and
personal interviews with some native chieftains on how the place got its
name. Based on unrecorded history, the place was sparsely populated
by few farming natives called Isamals who first settled the coastal areas
of the island. There were no known surveyed roads then except for a few
trails and pathways criss-crossing the lowland areas. Thick forest and
green land still covered the island's virgin soil.</p><br></i>

<center><i>In all these stories, what is the reason that made the sky rise?</i><br><b>Why the Sky Is High<br>
</b>(Tagalog)</p></center>

				<p>In the early days, when the sky was still low, two brothers named Ingat and Daskol lived with their
parents on earth.<br></p><p>
As their names indicate, Ingat was careful in everything he did and was therefore his father‘s right
hand man. He was always helping with the work in the field and his parents were very pleased with him.<br></p><p>
On the other hand, Daskol did his work sloppily. In the absence of a daughter in the family, the
house work came to be Daskol‘s responsibility. He fetched water, cleaned the house, and did the
cooking. He also did the pounding of the palay that his father and Ingat harvested. Even in pounding,
Daskol lived up to his name. Half of the grain he pounded scattered and fell to the ground. Being naturally
lazy and impatient, he did not like the work of pounding rice.<br></p><p>
One day, Daskol had to pound a greater quantity of palay than usual. He was irritated because
every time he raised the pestle higher, and every time it hit the sky, the sky would be raised. In his hurry,
Daskol did not notice that the sky was rising. When he finished pounding the rice, he looked up and
discovered that the sky had risen and it is where it is today.</p>
 
<br><br>
<p><center><strong> Why the Sky Is High<br></strong>
(Iloko)</center>
<p>In the olden days, the only people on earth were a man and a woman. One day, they ate venison
which the man had brought home from hunting. But because the bones were very big and they wanted to
eat the marrow, they thought of pounding the bones. The woman removed her comb and necklace and
hung them on the low sky. But whenever she pounded, she would hit the sky. So she requested the sky
to rise higher. It thundered and the sky rose higher. Still the pestle hit the sky. So the woman again asked
the sky to go higher. It thundered and the sky rose higher. Still the pestle hit the sky. So the woman
again asked the sky to go higher. Again it thundered and the sky rose as high as could be. When the
woman remembered what she had hung, it was too late. They became the moon and the stars. </p>
<br><br>
<p><center><strong> Why the Sky Is High<br></strong>
(Hiligaynon)
</center></p>
<p>In the olden days the sky was so low---so low that it could be reached by a stick of ordinary
length. The people in those days said that God had created the sky in such a way that he could hear his
people when they called to him. In turn, God could send his blessings to earth as soon as men needed
them. Because of this close connection between God and his subjects, the people were provided for, and
they did not need to work.<br></p><p>
Whenever they wanted to eat, they could simply call God. Before their request was made, almost,
the food would be on the table; but after the expulsion of Adam and Eve, God made men work for their
own living. With this change in their condition came the custom of holding feasts, when the men would
rest from their labors.<br></p><p>
One day one of the chiefs, Abing by name, held a feast. Many people came to enjoy it. A sayao,
or native war-dance, was given in honor of the men belonging to the chief, and it was acted by men
brandishing spears. While acting, one of the actors, who was drunk, tried to show his skill, but he forgot
that the sky was so low. When he darted his spear, he happened to pierce the sky, and one of the gods
was wounded. This angered God the Father: so he raised the sky as we have it today far from the earth. </p>

<center>Ibalon<br>
(Three Heroes of the Bicol Epic)
</b></p></strong></center>
<p>When the hero Baltog came to the rich land of
Ibalon, many monsters still roamed around in its very dark
forest. Baltog, born in Baltavara to the brave clan of Lipod,
was the first to cultivate the fields in the rich land of Ibalon.
<br></p><img src="img/8image.jpg" width="200"><p>
Then the Tandayag attacked and destroyed
Baltog‘s fields and crops. The Tandayag was a monstrous
wild boar but the hero Baltog was not afraid. One night, he
waited for the Tandayag and wrestled with it with all his
might. The Tandayag had very long fangs. The earth shook
at the Tandayag‘s step. But Baltog was strong and brave.
He was able to pin down the monstrous wild boar and tear
out its mouth.
<br></p><p>
Baltog carried the Tandayag and hung it on a talisay tree in front of his house in Tondol. The
people celebrated when they learned of the victory of their king Baltog. The clans of Panicuason and
Asog came over to marvel at the monstrous wild boar in Ibalon.
<br></p><p>
At that time the hero Handiong came with a band of warriors to the land of Ibalon. Handiong and
his men had to fight thousands of battles, and face many dangers to defeat the monsters. They first
fought the one-eyed giants in the land of Ponon. They fought without rest for ten months until all the oneeyed
giants were killed.
<br></p><p>
They went to the lair of the giant flying fishes called Tiburon which had slimy, scaly, and hardy
flesh and sawlike teeth that could crush rocks. Handiong and his men did not stop until they vanquished
every Tiburon.
<br></p><p>
They tamed the fierce tamaraws. They drove away the giant Sarimaw which was larger than an
elephant and very fierce. They used their spears and arrows to kill all the crocodiles which were bigger
than boats. The savage monkeys were frightened and hid when they
saw the rivers and swamps of Ibalon turn red with blood.
7 Oriol was the hardest to kill. A serpent with a beautiful voice, Oriol could change its image to
deceive enemies. Oriol had escaped every trap and disappeared.
<br></p><p>
All by himself, Handiong looked for Oriol in the heart of the forest. He followed the beautiful voice
and was almost enchanted by it in his pursuit. It is said that Oriol admired Handiong‘s bravery and
gallantry. Thus, the serpent taught the hero how to conquer the monsters until peace came to the whole
Ibalon.
<br></p><p> Handiong built a town in Isarog and a season of progress followed. Under Handiong‘s leadership,
the people planted rice which they named after him. He built the first boat to ride the waves of Ibalon
seas. Because of his good example, inventors came forth from his people. Ginantong made the plow,
harrow, and other farming tools. Hablom invented the first loom for weaving abaca clothes. Dinahon, an
Aeta, created the stove, cooking pot, earthen jar, and other kitchen utensils. The brilliant Sural thought of
the alphabet and started to write on white rock. It was a golden period in Ibalon when even slaves were
respected under the laws of Handiong.
10 But there came the big flood freed by Unos, with earthquakes and the eruption of the volcanoes
of Hantik, Kolasi, and Isarog. Rivers dried up and the seas receded. The earth parted, mountains sank,
and many towns in Ibalon were destroyed.
<br></p><p>Then appeared the giant Rabot, half-man half-beast, with terrible powers.
<br></p><p>Bantong, Handiong‘s good friend, was ordered to kill the new monster in Ibalon. He took with him
a thousand warriors to attack Rabot‘s den. Bantong used his wisdom against Rabot. He did not attack the
giant‘s den right away but instead observed Rabot‘s ways. He saw many rocks around the den. They
were people turned into rock by Rabot.
<br></p><p> He also learned that Rabot loved to sleep. When Rabot slept very soundly, Bantong was able to
go near him. The giant died with a single stab by the brave and wise Bantong. Ibalon was at peace once
more.

<p><center><b>Overseas Filipino Workers as Everyday Heroes
</b></center></p><br>
<p>Overseas Filipino Workers take a huge risk when they travel and work
abroad. OFWs sacrifice a lot in order to give a better life for their families.
They are heroes in their own right because they live to help their families and
sometimes even other people they do not even know, but are in need of their
help and support.</p><img src="img/9image.jpg" width="200"><p>
<br> Heroes think of other people first before they think of themselves. Heroes are unique individuals
that sacrifice themselves for the sake of others. OFWs face great challenges head on with only their faith,
hope, and determination to carry them through. They strive hard to ensure that their children‘s future
would be bright and that they would live a life that they have dreamed of.
<br> </p><p>What are OFWs made of? They are made of determination, courage, a risk-taking attitude, a
heart of gold, and other qualities that make them everyday heroes to a lot of people. They go beyond
their call of duty to help their families, to help their country and sometimes people in need, even if it
means putting themselves in danger.
<br></p><p>
You do not have to be an OFW to be a hero. You are a hero if you sacrifice a part of yourself to
help other people who are in need. You are a hero if you can make someone else smile despite the trials
and challenges he has. You are a hero if you can make others feel better about themselves. If you do any
of these, then you are a hero in a person‘s heart.

<p><b><strong>YOUR TEXT: <br>
<center>Indarapatra and Sulayman2<br>
(A Maranao Epic)</p></strong></center></b>

<p>A long, long time ago, Mindanao was covered with water, and the sea covered all the lowlands so
that nothing could be seen but the mountains jutting from it. There were many people living in the country
and all the highlands were dotted with villages and settlements. For many years the people prospered,
living in peace and contentment. Suddenly there appeared in the land four horrible monsters which, in a
short time, devoured every human being they could find. 
<br></p><p>
Kurita, a terrible creature with many limbs, lived partly on land and partly on sea, but its favorite
haunt was the mountain where the rattan palm grew and here it brought utter destruction on every living
thing. The second monster, Tarabusaw, an ugly creature in the form of a man, lived on Mt. Matutum, and
far and wide from that place he devoured the people, laying waste to the land. The third, an enormous
bird called Pah, was so large that, when on the wing, it covered the sun and brought darkness to the
earth. Its egg was as large as a house. Mt. Bita was its haunt; and there the only people who escaped its
voracity were those who hid in the mountain caves. The fourth monster was also a dreadful bird, having
seven heads and the power to see in all directions at the same time. Mt. Gurayan was its home and like
the others, it wrought havoc to its region.

<br></p><p>
So great was the death and destruction caused by these terrible creatures that at length, the
news spread even to the most distant lands – and all nations grieved to hear the sad fate of Mindanao. 
<br></p><p>
Now far across the sea, in the land of the golden sunset, was a city so great that to look at its
many people would injure the eyes of men. When tidings of these great disasters reached this distant city,
the heart of King Indarapatra was filled with compassion, and he called his brother, Sulayman, and
begged him to save the land of Mindanao from the monsters. 
<br></p><p>
Sulayman listened to the story and as he heard it, was moved with pity.
<br></p><p>
―I will go," zeal and enthusiasm adding to his strength, ―and the land shall be avenged,‖ said he.
King Indarapatra, proud of his brother‘s courage, gave him a ring and a sword as he wished him
success and safety. Then he placed a young sapling by his window and said to Sulayman, ―By this tree I
shall know your fate from the hour you depart from here, for if you live, it will live; but if you die, it will die
also."
<br></p><p>
So Sulayman departed for Mindanao, and he neither waded nor used a boat, but went through
the air and landed on the mountain where the rattan grew. There he stood on the summit and gazed
about on all sides. He looked on the land and the villages, but he could see no living thing. He became
very sorrowful and cried out: ―Alas, how pitiful and dreadful is this devastation.‖

<br> </p><p>No sooner had Sulayman uttered those words when the whole mountain began to move and
shake. Suddenly, out of the ground came the horrible creature, Kurita. It sprang at the man and sank its
claws into his flesh. But Sulayman, knowing at once that this was the scourge of the land, drew his sword
and cut Kurita to pieces.

<br></p><p>Encouraged by his first success, Sulayman went on to Mt. Matutum where conditions were even
worse. As he stood on the heights viewing the great devastation, there was a noise in the forest and a
movement in the trees. With a loud yell, Tarabusaw leaped forth. For a moment they looked at each
other, neither showing any sign of fear. Then Tarabusaw used all his powers to try to devour Sulayman
who fought back. For a long time, the battle continued, until at last, the monster fell exhausted to the
ground and Sulayman killed him with his sword. 

<br></p><p>The next place visited by Sulayman was Mt. Bita. Here havoc was present everywhere, and
though he passed by many homes, he saw that not a single soul was left. As he walked, sudden
darkness fell over the land, startling him. As he looked toward the sky he saw a great bird that was
swooping down on him. Immediately, he struck, and the bird fell dead at his feet; but the wing fell on
Sulayman and he was crushed. 
<br></p><p> He also learned that Rabot loved to sleep. When Rabot slept very soundly, Bantong was able to
go near him. The giant died with a single stab by the brave and wise Bantong. Ibalon was at peace once
more. 
<br></p><p> Now at this very moment, King Indarapatra was sitting at his window, and looking out he saw the
little tree wither and dry up.

<br></p><p> ―Alas!‖ he cried, ―my little brother is dead,‖ and he wept bitterly.
<br> He also learned that Rabot loved to sleep. When Rabot slept very soundly, Bantong was able to
go near him. The giant died with a single stab by the brave and wise Bantong. Ibalon was at peace once
more. 
<br></p><p> He, too, traveled through the air with great speed until he came to the mountain where the rattan
grew. There he looked about, awed at the great destruction, and when he saw the bones of Kurita, he
knew that his brother had been there. He went on until he came to Matutum, and when he saw the bones
of Tarabusaw, he knew that this too, was the work of Sulayman.

<br></p><p> Still searching for his brother, he arrived at Mt. Bita, where the dead bird lay on the ground, and
when he lifted the severed wing, he beheld the bones of Sulayman with his sword by his side. His grief
now so overwhelmed Indarapatra that he wept for some time. Upon looking up, he beheld a small jar of
water by his side. This, he knew had been sent from heaven, and he poured the water over the bones,
and Sulayman came to life again. They greeted each other and talked animatedly for a great length of
time. Sulayman declared that he had not been dead but asleep, and their hearts were full of joy.

<br></p><p> After some time, Sulayman returned to his distant home, but Indarapatra continued his journey to
Mt. Gurayan where he killed the dreadful bird with the seven heads. After these monsters had all been
killed, peace and safety had been restored to the land. Indarapatra began searching everywhere to see if
some of the people who hid in the earth were still alive.

<br></p><p> One day, in the course of his search, he caught sight of a beautiful woman. When he hastened
toward her, she disappeared through a hole in the ground where she stood. Disappointed and tired,
Indarapatra sat down on a rock when, looking about, he saw near him a pot of uncooked rice with a big fire on the ground in front of it. This revived him and he proceeded to cook the rice. As he did so,
however, he heard someone laugh nearby, and turning around, he beheld an old woman who was
watching him. As he greeted her, she drew near and talked to him while he ate the rice.
 
<br></p><p> Of all the people in the land, the woman told him, only few were left, and they hid in a cave in the
ground from where they never ventured to come out. As for herself and her old husband, she went on,
they had hidden in a hollow tree, and this they had never dared to leave until after Sulayman killed the
voracious bird Pah.
<br></p><p> At Indarapatra‘s request, the old woman led him to one such cave. There he met the headman
with his family and some people. They all gathered around the stranger, asking many questions, for this
was the first time they had heard about the death of the monsters. When they found out what Indarapatra
had done for them, the headman gave his daughter to Indarapatra in marriage, and she proved to be the
beautiful girl whom he had seen at the mouth of the cave.
<br></p><p> Then the people all came out of their hiding places and returned to their homes where they lived
in peace and happiness. And the sea withdrew from the land and gave the lowlands to the people.

<center>An Excerpt from The Life of Lam-ang<br>
(An Iloko epic)

<br><br>
 <p><center><b>The Story of Lam-ang (A Summary)</b></center></p><br>
 <p>Don Juan and his wife Namongan lived in Nalbuan, now part of La Union in the
northern part of the Philippines. They had a son named Lam-ang. Before Lam-ang was
born, Don Juan went to the mountains in order to punish a group of their Igorot
enemies. While he was away, his son Lam-ang was born. It took four people to help
Namongan give birth. As soon as the baby boy popped out, he spoke and asked that he
be given the name Lam-ang. He also chose his godparents and asked where his father
was. <br></p><p>
After nine months of waiting for his father to return, Lam-ang decided he would
go look for him. Namongan thought Lam-ang was up to the challenge but she was sad
to let him go. During his exhausting journey, he decided to rest for awhile. He fell asleep
and had a dream about his father's head being stuck on a pole by the Igorot. Lam-ang
was furious when he learned what had happened to his father. He rushed to their village and killed them all, except for one whom he let go so that he could tell other people
about Lam-ang's greatness. <br></p><p>
Upon returning to Nalbuan in triumph, he was bathed by women in the
Amburayan river. All the fish died because of the dirt and odor from Lam-ang's body. 
<br></p><p>
There was a young woman named Ines Kannoyan whom Lam-ang wanted to
woo. She lived in Calanutian and he brought along his white rooster and gray dog to
visit her. On the way, Lam-ang met his enemy Sumarang, another suitor of Ines whom
he fought and readily defeated.<br></p><p>
Lam-ang found the house of Ines surrounded by many suitors all of whom were
trying to catch her attention. He had his rooster crow, which caused a nearby house to
fall. This made Ines look out. He had his dog bark and in an instant the fallen house
rose up again. The girl's parents witnessed this and called for him. The rooster
expressed the love of Lam-ang. The parents agreed to a marriage with their daughter if
Lam-ang would give them a dowry valued at double their wealth. Lam-ang had no
problem fulfilling this condition and he and Ines were married.<br></p><p>
It was a tradition to have a newly married man swim in the river for the rarang
fish. Unfortunately, Lam-ang dove straight into the mouth of the water monster
Berkakan. Ines had Marcos get his bones, which she covered with a piece of cloth. His
rooster crowed and his dog barked and slowly the bones started to move. Back alive,
Lam-ang and his wife lived happily ever after with his white rooster and gray dog.
