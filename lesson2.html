<center> <b>THE CENTIPEDE<br></b>
by Rony V. Diaz
</center></p><br>

							<p>When I saw my sister, Delia, beating my dog with a stick, I felt hate heave like a caged, angry
beast in my chest. Out in the sun, the hair of my sister glinted like metal and, in her brown dress, she
looked like a sheathed dagger. Biryuk hugged the earth and screamed but I could not bound forward nor
cry out to my sister. She had a weak heart and she must not be surprised. So I held myself, my throat
swelled, and I felt hate rear and plunge in its cage of ribs.  
</p>
<br>
 	<p>I was thirteen when my father first took me hunting. All through the summer of that year, I had
tramped alone and unarmed the fields and forest around our farm. Then one afternoon in late July my
father told me I could use his shotgun.
</p>
<br>
 	<p>Beyond the ipil grove, in a grass field we spotted a covey of brown pigeons. In the open, they
kept springing to the air and gliding away every time we were within range. But finally they dropped to the
ground inside a wedge of guava trees. My father pressed my shoulder and I stopped. Then slowly, in a
half-crouch, we advanced. The breeze rose lightly; the grass scuffed against my bare legs. My father
stopped again. He knelt down and held my hand
</p>
<br>
	<p>―Wait for the birds to rise and then fire,‖ he whispered
</p>
<br>
 	<p>I pushed the safety lever of the rifle off and sighted along the barrel. The saddle of the stock felt
greasy on my cheek. The gun was heavy and my arm muscles twitched. My mouth was dry; I felt vaguely
sick. I wanted to sit down.
</p>
<br>
<p>―You forgot to spit,‖ my father said.</p>
<br>
<p>Father had told me that hunters always spat for luck before firing. I spat and I saw the breeze
bend the ragged, glassy threads of spittle toward the birds.
</p>
<br>
<p>―That‘s good,‖ Father said.
―Can‘t we throw a stone,‖ I whispered fiercely. ―It‘s taking them a long time.‖
―No, you‘ve to wait.‖
</p>
<br>
<p>Suddenly, a small dog yelping shrilly came tearing across the brooding plain of grass and small
trees. It raced across the plain in long slewy swoops, on outraged shanks that disappeared and flashed
alternately in the light of the cloud-banked sun. One of the birds whistled and the covey dispersed like
seeds thrown in the wind. I fired and my body shook with the fierce momentary life of the rifle. I saw three
pigeons flutter in a last convulsive effort to stay afloat, then fall to the ground. The shot did not scare the
dog. He came to us, sniffing cautiously. He circled around us until I snapped my fingers and then he
came to me.
</p>
<br>
<p>―Not bad,‖ my father said grinning. ―Three birds with one tube.‖ I went to the brush to get the
birds. The dog ambled after me. He found the birds for me. The breast of one of the birds was torn. The
bird had fallen on a spot where the earth was worn bare, and its blood was spread like a tiny, red rag. The
dog scraped the blood with his tongue. I picked up the birds and its warm, mangled flesh clung to the
palm of my hand.
</p>
<br>
<p>―You‘re keen,‖ I said to the dog. ―Here. Come here.‖ I offered him my bloody palm. He came to
me and licked my palm clean.<br>
I gave the birds to my father. ―May I keep him, Father?‖ I said pointing to the dog. He put the birds
in a leather bag which he carried strapped around his waist.<br>
Father looked at me a minute and then said: ―Well, I‘m not sure. That dog belongs to somebody.‖<br>
―May I keep him until his owner comes for him?‖ I pursued.<br>
―He‘d make a good pointer,‖ Father remarked. ―But I would not like my son to be accused of dogstealing.‖<br>
―Oh, no!‖ I said quickly. ―I shall return him when the owner comes to claim him.‖<br>
―All right,‖ he said, ―I hope that dog makes a hunter out of you.‖</p>
<br>
<p>Biryuk and I became fast friends. Every afternoon after school we went to the field to chase quails
or to the bank of the river which was fenced by tall, blade-sharp reeds to flush snipes. Father was away
most of the time but when he was home he hunted with us.
</p>
<br>
<p>Biryuk scampered off and my sister flung the stick at him. Then she turned about and she saw
me.
</p>

<br>
<p>―Eddie, come here,‖ she commanded. I approached with apprehension. Slowly, almost carefully,
she reached over and twisted my ear</p>
<br>
<p>―I don‘t want to see that dog again in the house,‖ she said coldly. ―That dog destroyed my slippers
again. I‘ll tell Berto to kill that dog if I see it around again.‖ She clutched one side of my face with her hot,
moist hand and shoved me, roughly. I tumbled to the ground. But I did not cry or protest. I had passed
that phase. Now, every word and gesture she hurled at me I caught and fed to my growing and restless
hate.</p><br>
<p>My sister was the meanest creature I knew. She was eight when I was born, the day my mother
died. Although we continued to live in the same house, she had gone, it seemed, to another country from
where she looked at me with increasing annoyance and contempt.</p>
<br>
<p>One of my first solid memories was of standing before a grass hut. Its dirt floor was covered with
white banana stalks, and there was a small box filled with crushed and dismembered flowers in one
corner. A doll was cradled in the box. It was my sister‘s playhouse and I remembered she told me to keep
out of it. She was not around so I went in. The fresh banana hides were cold under my feet. The interior
of the hut was rife with the sour smell of damp dead grass. Against the flowers, the doll looked incredibly
heavy. I picked it up. It was slight but it had hard, unflexing limbs. I tried to bend one of the legs and it
snapped. I stared with horror at the hollow tube that was the leg of the doll. Then I saw my sister coming.
I hid the leg under one of the banana pelts. She was running and I knew she was furious. The walls of the
hut suddenly constricted me. I felt sick with a nameless pain. My sister snatched the doll from me and
when she saw the torn leg she gasped. She pushed me hard and I crashed against the wall of the hut.
The flimsy wall collapsed over me. I heard my sister screaming; she denounced me in a high, wild voice
and my body ached with fear. She seized one of the saplings that held up the hut and hit me again and
again until the flesh of my back and thighs sang with pain. Then suddenly my sister moaned; she
stiffened, the sapling fell from her hand and quietly, as though a sling were lowering her, she sank to the
ground. Her eyes were wild as scud and on the edges of her lips, drawn tight over her teeth, quivered a
wide lace of froth. I ran to the house yelling for Father.
</p><br>
<p>She came back from the hospital in the city, pale and quiet and mean, drained, it seemed, of all
emotions, she moved and acted with the keen, perversity and deceptive dullness of a sheathed knife,
concealing in her body that awful power for inspiring fear and pain and hate, not always with its drawn
blade but only with its fearful shape, defined by the sheath as her meanness was defined by her body 
</p><br>
<p>Nothing I did ever pleased her. She destroyed willfully anything I liked. At first, I took it as a
process of adaptation, a step of adjustment; I snatched and crushed every seed of anger she planted in
me, but later on I realized that it had become a habit with her. I did not say anything when she told Berto
to kill my monkey because it snickered at her one morning, while she was brushing her teeth. I did not
say anything when she told Father that she did not like my pigeon house because it stank and I had to
give away my pigeons and Berto had to chop the house into kindling wood. I learned how to hold myself
because I knew we had to put up with her whims to keep her calm and quiet. But when she dumped my
butterflies into a waste can and burned them in the backyard, I realized that she was spiting me.
</p><br>
<p>My butterflies never snickered at her and they did not smell. I kept them in an unused cabinet in
the living room and unless she opened the drawers, they were out of her sight. And she knew too that my
butterfly collection had grown with me. But when I arrived home, one afternoon, from school, I found my
butterflies in a can, burned in their cotton beds like deckle. I wept and Father had to call my sister for an
explanation. She stood straight and calm before Father but my tear-logged eyes saw only her harsh and
arrogant silhouette. She looked at me curiously but she did not say anything and Father began gently to
question her. She listened politely and when Father had stopped talking, she said without rush, heat or
concern: ―They were attracting ants.‖
</p><br>
<p>I ran after Biryuk. He had fled to the brambles. I ran after him, bugling his name. I found him
under a low, shriveled bush. I called him and he only whimpered. Then I saw that one of his eyes was
bleeding. I sat on the ground and looked closer. The eye had been pierced. The stick of my sister had stabbed the eye of my dog. I was stunned. For a long time I sat motionless, staring at Biryuk. Then I felt
hate crouch; its paws dug hard into the floor of its cage; it bunched muscles tensed; it held itself for a
minute and then it sprang and the door of the cage crashed open and hate clawed wildly my brain. I
screamed. Biryuk, frightened, yelped and fled, rattling the dead bush that sheltered him. I did not run after
him. 


</p><br>
<p>A large hawk wheeled gracefully above a group of birds. It flew in a tightening spiral above the
birds.
</p><br>
<p>On my way back to the house, I passed the woodshed. I saw Berto in the shade of a tree, splitting
wood. He was splitting the wood he had stacked last year. A mound of bone-white slats was piled near
his chopping block. When he saw me, he stopped and called me

</p><br>
<p>His head was drenched with sweat. He brushed away the sweat and hair from his eyes and said
to me: ―I‘ve got something for you.‖
</p><br>
<p>He dropped his ax and walked into the woodshed. I followed him. Berto went to a corner of the
shed. I saw a jute sack spread on the ground. Berto stopped and picked up the sack.
</p><br>
<p>―Look,‖ he said.
</p><br>

<p>―It‘s large,‖ I said.
</p><br>
<p>―I found him under the stack I chopped.‖ Berto smiled happily; he looked at me with his muddy
eyes.
―
</p><br>
<p>―You know,‖ he said. ―That son of a devil nearly frightened me to death‖
</p><br>
<p>I stiffened. ―Did it, really?‖ I said trying to control my rising voice. Berto was still grinning and I felt
hot all over.
</p><br>

<p>―I didn‘t expect to find any centipede here,‖ he said. ―It nearly bit me. Who wouldn‘t get shocked?‖
He bent and picked up a piece of wood.
</p><br>
<p>―This wood was here,‖ he said and put down the block. ―Then I picked it up, like this. And this
centipede was coiled here. Right here. I nearly touched it with my hand. What do you think you would
feel?‖
</p><br>
<p>I did not answer. I squatted to look at the reptile. Its antennae quivered searching the tense
afternoon air. I picked up a sliver of wood and prodded the centipede. It uncoiled viciously. Its pinchers
slashed at the tiny spear.
</p><br>
<p>―I could carry it dead,‖ I said half-aloud.<br>
―Yes,‖ Berto said. ―I did not kill him because I knew you would like it.‖<br>
―Yes, you‘re right.‖<br>
―That‘s bigger than the one you found last year, isn‘t it?‖<br>
―Yes, it‘s very much bigger.‖<br>

</p><br>
<p>I stuck the sliver into the carapace of the centipede. It went through the flesh under the red armor;
a whitish liquid oozed out. Then I made sure it was dead by brushing its antennae. The centipede did not
move. I wrapped it in a handkerchief
</p><br>
<p>My sister was enthroned in a large chair in the porch of the house. Her back was turned away
from the door; she sat facing the window. She was embroidering a strip of white cloth. I went near, I stood
behind her chair. She was not aware of my presence. I unwrapped the centipede. I threw it on her lap
</p><br>
<p>My sister shrieked and the strip of white sheet flew off like an unhanded hawk. She shot up from
her chair, turned around and she saw me but she collapsed again to her chair clutching her breast,
doubled up with pain The centipede had fallen to the floor
</p><br>
<p>―You did it,‖ she gasped. ―You tried to kill me. You‘ve health… life… you tried…‖ Her voice
dragged off into a pain-stricken moan.
</p><br>
<p>I was engulfed by a sudden feeling of pity and guilt
</p><br>
<p>―But it‘s dead!‖ I cried kneeling before her. ―It‘s dead! Look! Look!‖ I snatched up the centipede
and crushed its head between my fingers. ―It‘s dead!‖
</p><br>
<p>My sister did not move. I held the centipede before her like a hunter displaying the tail of a deer,
save that the centipede felt thorny in my hand.

<center> <b>The Mats<br>
by Francisco Arcellana
</b></center></p>
<p>1 For the Angeles family, Mr. Angeles'; homecoming from his periodic inspection trips was always an
occasion for celebration. But his homecoming--from a trip to the South--was fated to be more memorable
than, say, of the others.<br></p><p>
He had written from Mariveles: "I have just met a marvelous matweaver--a real artist--and I shall have a
surprise for you. I asked him to weave a sleeping-mat for every one of the family. He is using many
different colors and for each mat the dominant color is that of our respective birthstones. I am sure that the
children will be very pleased. I know you will be. I can hardly wait to show them to you."<br></p><p>
Nana Emilia read the letter that morning, and again and again every time she had a chance to leave the
kitchen. In the evening when all the children were home from school she asked her oldest son, José, to
read the letter at dinner table. The children became very much excited about the mats, and talked about
them until late into the night. This she wrote her husband when she labored over a reply to him. For days
after that, mats continued to be the chief topic of conversation among the children.<br></p><p>
Finally, from Lopez, Mr. Angeles wrote again: "I am taking the Bicol Express tomorrow. I have the mats with
me, and they are beautiful. God willing, I shall be home to join you at dinner."
</p><br> <br>
<p>2 The letter was read aloud during the noon meal. Talk about the mats flared up again like wildfire.
"I like the feel of mats," Antonio, the third child, said. "I like the smell of new mats."<br></p><p>
"Oh, but these mats are different," interposed Susanna, the fifth child. "They have our names woven into
them, and in our ascribed colors, too."<br></p><p>
The children knew what they were talking about: they knew just what a decorative mat was like; it was not
anything new or strange in their experience. That was why they were so excited about the matter. They had
such a mat in the house, one they seldom used, a mat older than any one of them.<br></p><p>
This mat had been given to Nana Emilia by her mother when she and Mr. Angeles were married, and it had
been with them ever since. It had served on the wedding night, and had not since been used except on
special occasions.<br></p><p>
It was a very beautiful mat, not really meant to be ordinarily used. It had green leaf borders, and a lot of
gigantic red roses woven into it. In the middle, running the whole length of the mat, was the lettering: Emilia
y Jaime Recuerdo.<br></p><p>
The letters were in gold.
</p><br>
<p>3 Nana Emilia always kept that mat in her trunk. When any one of the family was taken ill, the mat was
brought out and the patient slept on it, had it all to himself. Every one of the children had some time in their
lives slept on it; not a few had slept on it more than once.<br></p><p>
Most of the time the mat was kept in Nana Emilia's trunk, and when it was taken out and spread on the floor
the children were always around to watch. At first there had been only Nana Emilia to see the mat spread.
Then a child--a girl--watched with them. The number of watchers increased as more children came.<br></p><p>
The mat did not seem to age. It seemed to Nana Emilia always as new as when it had been laid on the
nuptial bed. To the children it seemed as new as the first time it was spread before them. The folds and
creases always new and fresh. The smell was always the smell of a new mat. Watching the intricate design
was an endless joy. The children's pleasure at the golden letters even before they could work out the
meaning was boundless. Somehow they were always pleasantly shocked by the sight of the mat: so
delicate and so consummate the artistry of its weave.<br></p><p>
Now, taking out that mat to spread had become a kind of ritual. The process had become associated with
illness in the family. Illness, even serious illness, had not been infrequent. There had been deaths...
</p><br></p><p>
<p>4 In the evening Mr. Angeles was with his family. He had brought the usual things home with him. There
was a lot of fruits, as always (his itinerary carried him through the fruit-growing provinces): pineapples,
lanzones, chicos, atis, santol, sandia, guyabano, avocado, according to the season. He had also brought
home a jar of preserved sweets from Lopez.<br></p><p>
Putting away the fruit, sampling them, was as usual accomplished with animation and lively talk. Dinner
was a long affair. Mr. Angeles was full of stories about his trip but would interrupt his tales with: "I could not
sleep nights thinking of the young ones. They should never be allowed to play in the streets. And you older
ones should not stay out too late at night."<br></p><p>
The stories petered out and dinner was over. Putting away the dishes and wiping the dishes and wiping the
table clean did not at all seem tedious. Yet Nana and the children, although they did not show it, were all on
edge about the mats.<br></p><p>
Finally, after a long time over his cigar, Mr. Angeles rose from his seat at the head of the table and crossed
the room to the corner where his luggage had been piled. From the heap he disengaged a ponderous
bundle.
</p><br>
<p>5 Taking it under one arm, he walked to the middle of the room where the light was brightest. He dropped
the bundle and, bending over and balancing himself on his toes, he strained at the cord that bound it. It was
strong, it would not break, it would not give way. He tried working at the knots. His fingers were clumsy,
they had begun shaking.<br></p><p>
He raised his head, breathing heavily, to ask for the scissors. Alfonso, his youngest boy, was to one side of
him with the scissors ready.<br></p><p>
Nana Emilia and her eldest girl who had long returned from the kitchen were watching the proceedings
quietly<br></p><p>
One swift movement with the scissors, snip! and the bundle was loose.
Turning to Nana Emilia, Mr. Angeles joyfully cried: "These are the mats, Miling." Mr. Angeles picked up the
topmost mat in the bundle.<br></p><p>
"This, I believe, is yours, Miling."
</p><br>
<p>6 Nana Emilia stepped forward to the light, wiping her still moist hands against the folds of her skirt, and
with a strange young shyness received the mat. The children watched the spectacle silently and then broke
into delighted, though a little self-conscious, laughter. Nana Emilia unfolded the mat without a word. It was
a beautiful mat: to her mind, even more beautiful than the one she received from her mother on her
wedding. There was a name in the very center of it: EMILIA. The letters were large, done in green. Flowers-
-cadena-de-amor--were woven in and out among the letters. The border was a long winding twig of
cadena-de-amor<br></p><p>
The children stood about the spreading mat. The air was punctuated by their breathless exclamations of
delight.<br></p><p>
"It is beautiful, Jaime; it is beautiful!" Nana Emilia's voice broke, and she could not say any more.<br>
"And this, I know, is my own," said Mr. Angeles of the next mat in the bundle. The mat was rather simply
decorated, the design almost austere, and the only colors used were purple and gold. The letters of the
name Jaime were in purple.<br></p><p>
"And this, for your, Marcelina."<br></p><p>
Marcelina was the oldest child. She had always thought her name too long; it had been one of her worries
with regard to the mat. "How on earth are they going to weave all of the letters of my name into my mat?"
she had asked of almost everyone in the family. Now it delighted her to see her whole name spelled out on
the mat, even if the letters were a little small. Besides, there was a device above her name which pleased
Marcelina very much. It was in the form of a lyre, finely done in three colors. Marcelina was a student of
music and was quite a proficient pianist.</p><br>
<p>7 "And this is for you, José."<br></p><p>
José was the second child. He was a medical student already in the third year of medical school. Over his
name the symbol of Aesculapius was woven into the mat.<br></p><p>
"You are not to use this mat until the year of your internship," Mr. Angeles was saying.<br></p><p>
"This is yours, Antonia."<br></p><p>
"And this is yours, Juan."
"And this is yours, Jesus."<br></p><p>
Mat after mat was unfolded. On each of the children's mats there was somehow an appropriate device.<br></p><p>
At least all the children had been shown their individual mats. The air was filled with their excited talk, and
through it all Mr. Angeles was saying over and over again in his deep voice: 
"You are not to use these mats until you go to the University."<br></p><p>
Then Nana Emilia noticed bewilderingly that there were some more mats remaining to be unfolded.<br></p><p>
"But Jaime," Nana Emilia said, wondering, with evident repudiation, "there are some more mats."
</p><br>
<p>8 Only Mr. Angeles seemed to have heard Nana Emilia's words. He suddenly stopped talking, as if he had
been jerked away from a pleasant fantasy. A puzzled, reminiscent look came into his eyes, superseding the
deep and quiet delight that had been briefly there, and when he spoke his voice was different.<br></p><p>
"Yes, Emilia," said Mr. Angeles, "There are three more mats to unfold. The others who aren't here..."<br></p><p>
Nana Emilia caught her breath; there was a swift constriction in her throat; her face paled and she could not
say anything.<br></p><p>
The self-centered talk of the children also died. There was a silence as Mr. Angeles picked up the first of
the remaining mats and began slowly unfolding it.<br></p><p>
The mat was almost as austere in design as Mr. Angeles' own, and it had a name. There was no symbol or
device above the name; only a blank space, emptiness.<br></p><p>
The children knew the name. But somehow the name, the letters spelling the name, seemed strange to
them.<br></p><p>
Then Nana Emilia found her voice.<br></p><p>
"You know, Jaime, you didn't have to," Nana Emilia said, her voice hurt and surely frightened.
</p><br>
<p>9 Mr. Angeles held his tears back; there was something swift and savage in the movement.<br></p><p>
"Do you think I'd forgotten? Do you think I had forgotten them? Do you think I could forget them?<br></p><p>
"This is for you, Josefina!<br></p><p>
"And this is for you, Victoria!<br></p><p>
"And this is for you, Concepcion."<br></p><p>
Mr. Angeles called the names rather than uttered them.<br></p><p>
"Don't, Jaime, please don't," was all that Nana Emilia managed to say.<br></p><p>
"Is it fair to forget them? Would it be just to disregard them?" Mr. Angeles demanded rather than asked.</p><br>
<p>10 His voice had risen shrill, almost hysterical; it was also stern and sad, and somehow vindictive. Mr.
Angeles had spoken almost as if he were a stranger.<br></p><p>
Also, he had spoken as if from a deep, grudgingly-silent, long-bewildered sorrow.<br></p><p>
The children heard the words exploding in the silence. They wanted to turn away and not see the face of
their father. But they could neither move nor look away; his eyes held them, his voice held them where they
were. They seemed rooted to the spot.<br></p><p>
Nana Emilia shivered once or twice, bowed her head, gripped her clasped hands between her thighs.
There was a terrible hush. The remaining mats were unfolded in silence. The names which were with
infinite slowness revealed, seemed strange and stranger still; the colors not bright but deathly dull; the
separate letters, spelling out the names of the dead among them, did not seem to glow or shine with a
festive sheen as did the other living names.</p>

<p><center><b>Sky Sown With Stars</b></center></p>
<p>
A thousand times in my dreams I have walked with you,<br>
Hand in hand, down the glittery way,<br>
Without a worry, not a care in the world,<br>
No sorrow, no torture, no dismay,<br>
There we were: two figures in the incessant night,<br>
Swallowed by the searing darkness,<br>
Embraced by the fleeting sadness,<br>
And then we would look to the sky and see,<br>
The shining harvest of the distant stars,<br>
Our sky, our sky, my Starlight,<br>
Our sky sown with stars.<br>
<br><br>
We would find a blissful spot along the shore,<br>
And sit down together, in the flowing sand,<br>
Feeling it warm our bodies.<br>
We would see the waves crash gently, on the beach,<br>
And retreat towards the ocean again.<br>
The dark blue sky and pale yellow moonlight,<br>
Would touch our skin and beg us to look up again,<br>
To the dark blue blanket in the sky,<br>
Our dark blue blanket in the sky,<br>
Our sky sown with stars.<br>
<br><br>
You would lay your drowsy head on my shoulder,<br>
and I would sense your sorrows, fears, and joys,<br>
As the night grows younger, the breeze colder,<br>
I would kiss your eyes and hold your hand,<br>
Tonight, I am the universe's happiest being.<br>
With you, with you, my Muse,<br>
Together in this eternity of light,<br>
Souls in love, souls in deep love,<br>
Bound together in the evening,<br>
Looking up the sky, heavenward to the stars,<br>
Our sky still sown with stars.<br><br>
Then you would weep gently in your bliss,<br>
And I would taste the sadness, taste the tears,<br>
The beauty makes us sigh, the sky made us cry,<br>
Our heavens, our skies, still glittering away<br>
We savor the sweet night until the break of day,<br>
No word has passed thru our lips,<br>
Just the touch, the love, in our fingertips,<br>
Glancing at each other in deep passion,<br>
Our voices lost in the silent hum of the ocean,<br>
Our souls wedlocked in the pale moonlight,<br>
Our foreheads touching, see the sky! The warmth!<br>
Our sky, my Muse, this is ours, our sky,<br>
Our ocean, our sand, our moment, our love,<br>
And our sky sown with stars.<br>

<p class="paragraph1">I see your eyes,<br>
one final glance as you look back at me,<br>
Although I swore<br>
I would never have to let you go<br>
It‘s a promise I cannot keep.<br>
<p>I need to live<br>
and you need to grow.<br>
</p><br><br>
<p>My heart folds back onto itself<br>
And I just bend my knees and lower my<br>

To withstand the buffet of the winds<br>
That will blow me,<br>

Without you standing there to shelter me.</p><br><br>
<p>The tether is cut,<br>
and you are free to fly<br>
and I lose an anchor,<br>

<p>Look back no more<br>
Eyes to the future<br>
And I will just stand here<br>

<p><center> <b>Wedding Dance<br></b>
by Amador Daguio

</p></center>
<br>
<p>Awiyao reached for the upper horizontal log which served as the edge of the head high
threshold. Clinging to the log, he lifted himself with one bound that carried him across
to the narrow door. He slid back the cover, stepped inside, then pushed the cover back
in place. After some moments during which he seemed to wait, he talked to the listening
darkness.



</p><br>
<p>"I'm sorry this had to be done. I am really sorry. But neither of us can help it."

</p><br>

<p>
The sound of the gangsas beat through the walls of the dark house like muffled
roars of falling waters. The woman who had moved with a start when the sliding door
opened had been hearing the gangsas for she did not know how long. There was a
sudden rush of fire in her. She gave no sign that she heard Awiyao, but continued to sit
unmoving in the darkness.
4But Awiyao knew that she heard him and his heart pitied her. He crawled on all
fours to the middle of the room; he knew exactly where the stove was. With bare fingers
he stirred the covered smoldering embers, and blew into the stove. When the coals
began to glow, Awiyao put pieces of pine on them, then full round logs as his arms. The
room brightened.
<br></p><p>
"Why don't you go out," he said, "and join the dancing women?" He felt a pang
inside him, because what he said was really not the right thing to say and because the
woman did not stir. "You should join the dancers," he said, "as if--as if nothing had
happened." He looked at the woman huddled in a corner of the room, leaning against
the wall. The stove fire played with strange moving shadows and lights upon her face.
She was partly sullen, but her sullenness was not because of anger or hate.
<br></p><p>
"Go out--go out and dance. If you really don't hate me for this separation, go out
and dance. One of the men will see you dance well; he will like your dancing, he will
marry you. Who knows but that, with him, you will be luckier than you were with me."
<br></p><p>
"I don't want any man," she said sharply. "I don't want any other man."
8He felt relieved that at least she talked: "You know very well that I won't want
any other woman either. You know that, don't you? Lumnay, you know it, don't you?"
</p><br>
<p>She did not answer him.<br>
"You know it Lumnay, don't you?" he repeated.<br>
"Yes, I know," she said weakly.
</p><br>
<p>"It is not my fault," he said, feeling relieved. "You cannot blame me; I have been
a good husband to you."
<br></p><p>"Neither can you blame me," she said. She seemed about to cry.
<br></p><p>"No, you have been very good to me. You have been a good wife. I have
nothing to say against you." He set some of the burning wood in place. "It's only that a
man must have a child. Seven harvests is just too long to wait. Yes, we have waited too
long. We should have another chance before it is too late for both of us."
13This time the woman stirred, stretched her right leg out and bent her left leg in.
She wound the blanket more snugly around herself.
<br></p><p>"You know that I have done my best," she said. "I have prayed to Kabunyan
much. I have sacrificed many chickens in my prayers."
"Yes, I know."
<br></p><p>"You remember how angry you were once when you came home from your
work in the terrace because I butchered one of our pigs without your permission? I did it
to appease Kabunyan, because, like you, I wanted to have a child. But what could I
do?"
<br></p><p>"Kabunyan does not see fit for us to have a child," he said. He stirred the fire.
The spark rose through the crackles of the flames. The smoke and soot went up the
ceiling.
<br></p><p>Lumnay looked down and unconsciously started to pull at the rattan that kept
the split bamboo flooring in place. She tugged at the rattan flooring. Each time she did
this the split bamboo went up and came down with a slight rattle. The gong of the
dancers clamorously called in her care through the walls.
<br></p><p>Awiyao went to the corner where Lumnay sat, paused before her, looked at her
bronzed and sturdy face, then turned to where the jars of water stood piled one over the
other. Awiyao took a coconut cup and dipped it in the top jar and drank. Lumnay had
filled the jars from the mountain creek early that evening.
<br></p><p>"I came home," he said. "Because I did not find you among the dancers. Of
course, I am not forcing you to come, if you don't want to join my wedding ceremony. I
came to tell you that Madulimay, although I am marrying her, can never become as
good as you are. She is not as strong in planting beans, not as fast in cleaning water
jars, not as good keeping a house clean. You are one of the best wives in the
whole village."
<br></p><p>"That has not done me any good, has it?" She said. She looked at him lovingly.
She almost seemed to smile.
22He put the coconut cup aside on the floor and came closer to her. He held her
face between his hands and looked longingly at her beauty. But her eyes looked away. Never again would he hold her face. The next day she would not be his any more. She
would go back to her parents. He let go of her face, and she bent to the floor again and
looked at her fingers as they tugged softly at the split bamboo floor. </p><br>
<p>"This house is yours," he said. "I built it for you. Make it your own, live in it as
long as you wish. I will build another house for Madulimay."
"I have no need for a house," she said slowly. "I'll go to my own house. My
parents are old. They will need help in the planting of the beans, in the pounding of the
rice."
<br></p><p>"I will give you the field that I dug out of the mountains during the first year of
our marriage," he said. "You know I did it for you. You helped me to make it for the two
of us."
"I have no use for any field," she said.
He looked at her, then turned away, and became silent. They were silent for a
time.
<br></p><p>"Go back to the dance," she said finally. "It is not right for you to be here. They
will wonder where you are, and Madulimay will not feel good. Go back to the dance."
<br></p><p>"I would feel better if you could come, and dance---for the last time. The
gangsas are playing."<br></p><p>
"You know that I cannot."
<br></p><p>"Lumnay," he said tenderly. "Lumnay, if I did this it is because of my need for a
child. You know that life is not worth living without a child. The men have mocked me
behind my back. You know that."<br></p><p>
"I know it," she said. "I will pray that Kabunyan will bless you and Madulimay."
<br></p><p>She bit her lips now, then shook her head wildly, and sobbed.
29She thought of the seven harvests that had passed, the high hopes they had in
the beginning of their new life, the day he took her away from her parents across the
roaring river, on the other side of the mountain, the trip up the trail which they had to
climb, the steep canyon which they had to cross. The waters boiled in her mind in forms
of white and jade and roaring silver; the waters tolled and growled,
resounded in thunderous echoes through the walls of the stiff cliffs; they were far away
now from somewhere on the tops of the other ranges, and they had looked carefully at
the buttresses of rocks they had to step on---a slip would have meant death.
<br></p><p>They both drank of the water then rested on the other bank before they made
the final climb to the other side of the mountain.
<br></p><p>She looked at his face with the fire playing upon his features---hard and strong, and kind. He had a sense of lightness in his way of saying things which often made her
and the village people laugh. How proud she had been of his humor. The muscles
where taut and firm, bronze and compact in their hold upon his skull---how frank his
bright eyes were. She looked at his body the carved out of the mountains
five fields for her; his wide and supple torso heaved as if a slab of shining lumber were
heaving; his arms and legs flowed down in fluent muscles--he was strong and for that
she had lost him.
</p><br>
<p> She flung herself upon his knees and clung to them. "Awiyao, Awiyao, my
husband," she cried. "I did everything to have a child," she said passionately in a hoarse
whisper. "Look at me," she cried. "Look at my body. Then it was full of promise. It could
dance; it could work fast in the fields; it could climb the mountains fast. Even now it is
firm, full. But, Awiyao, I am useless. I must die."
<br></p><p>"It will not be right to die," he said, gathering her in his arms. Her whole warm
naked naked breast quivered against his own; she clung now to his neck, and her hand
lay upon his right shoulder; her hair flowed down in cascades of gleaming darkness.
<br></p><p>"I don't care about the fields," she said. "I don't care about the house. I don't
care for anything but you. I'll have no other man."
"Then you'll always be fruitless."<br></p><p>
<br></p><p>"I'll go back to my father, I'll die."<br></p><p>
"Then you hate me," he said. "If you die it means you hate me. You do not want
me to have a child. You do not want my name to live on in our tribe."<br></p><p>
She was silent.<br></p><p>
<br></p><p>"If I do not try a second time," he explained, "it means I'll die. Nobody will get
the fields I have carved out of the mountains; nobody will come after me."
<br></p><p>"If you fail--if you fail this second time--" she said thoughtfully. The voice was a
shudder. "No--no, I don't want you to fail."
<br></p><p>"If I fail," he said, "I'll come back to you. Then both of us will die together. Both
of us will vanish from the life of our tribe."
39The gongs thundered through the walls of their house, sonorous and faraway.
<br></p><p>"I'll keep my beads," she said. "Awiyao, let me keep my beads," she halfwhispered.
"You will keep the beads. They come from far-off times. My grandmother said
they come from up North, from the slant-eyed people across the sea. You keep them,
Lumnay. They are worth twenty fields."<br></p><p>
"I'll keep them because they stand for the love you have for me," she said you. I love you and have nothing to give."</p><br>

<p> She took herself away from him, for a voice was calling out to him from outside.
"Awiyao! Awiyao! O Awiyao! They are looking for you at the dance!"<br>
"I am not in hurry."<br></p><p>
"The elders will scold you. You had better go."<br></p><p>
"Not until you tell me that it is all right with you."<br></p><p>
42"It is all right with me."<br></p><p>
He clasped her hands. "I do this for the sake of the tribe," he said.<br></p><p>
"I know," she said.<br></p><p>
He went to the door.<br></p><p>
43"Awiyao!"<br>
</p><br>

<p>He stopped as if suddenly hit by a spear. In pain he turned to her. Her face was
in agony. It pained him to leave. She had been wonderful to him. What was it that made
a man wish for a child? What was it in life, in the work in the field, in the planting and
harvest, in the silence of the night, in the communing with husband and wife, in the
whole life of the tribe itself that made man wish for the laughter and speech of a child?
Suppose he changed his mind? Why did the unwritten law demand, anyway, that a
man, to be a man, must have a child to come after him? And if he was fruitless--but he
loved Lumnay. It was like taking away of his life to leave her like this.
<br></p><p>"Awiyao," she said, and her eyes seemed to smile in the light. "The beads!" He
turned back and walked to the farthest corner of their room, to the trunk where they kept
their worldly possession---his battle-ax and his spear points, her betel nut box and her
beads. He dug out from the darkness the beads which had been given to him by his
grandmother to give to Lumnay on the beads on, and tied them in place. The white and
jade and deep orange obsidians shone in the firelight. She suddenly clung to him, clung
to his neck as if she would never let him go.
<br></p><p>"Awiyao! Awiyao, it is hard!" She gasped, and she closed her eyes and buried
her face in his neck.
47The call for him from the outside repeated; her grip loosened, and he buried out
into the night.
<br></p><p>Lumnay sat for some time in the darkness. Then she went to the door and
opened it. The moonlight struck her face; the moonlight spilled itself on the whole
village.
<br></p><p>She could hear the throbbing of the gangsas coming to her through the caverns 
of the other houses. She knew that all the houses were empty that the whole tribe was
at the dance. Only she was absent. And yet was she not the best dancer of the village?
Did she not have the most lightness and grace? Could she not, alone among all women,
dance like a bird tripping for grains on the ground, beautifully
timed to the beat of the gangsas? Did not the men praise her supple body, and the
women envy the way she stretched her hands like the wings of the mountain eagle now
and then as she danced? How long ago did she dance at her own wedding? Tonight, all
the women who counted, who once danced in her honor, were dancing now in honor of
another whose only claim was that perhaps she could give her
husband a child.
</p><br>


<p>"It is not right. It is not right!" she cried. "How does she know? How can
anybody know? It is not right," she said.
51Suddenly she found courage. She would go to the dance. She would go to the
chief of the village, to the elders, to tell them it was not right. Awiyao was hers; nobody
could take him away from her. Let her be the first woman to complain, to denounce the
unwritten rule that a man may take another woman. She would tell Awiyao to come
back to her. He surely would relent. Was not their love as strong as the
river?
<br></p><p>She made for the other side of the village where the dancing was. There was a
flaming glow over the whole place; a great bonfire was burning. The gangsas clamored
more loudly now, and it seemed they were calling to her. She was near at last. She
could see the dancers clearly now. The man leaped lightly with their gangsas as they
circled the dancing women decked in feast garments and beads, tripping on the ground
like graceful birds, following their men. Her heart warmed to the flaming call of the
dance; strange heat in her blood welled up, and she started to run. But the gleaming
brightness of the bonfire commanded her to stop. Did anybody see her approach?
She stopped. What if somebody had seen her coming? The flames of the bonfire leaped
in countless sparks which spread and rose like yellow points and died out in the night.
The blaze reached out to her like a spreading radiance. She did not have the courage to
break into the wedding feast.
<br></p><p>Lumnay walked away from the dancing ground, away from the village. She
thought of the new clearing of beans which Awiyao and she had started to make only
four moons before. She followed the trail above the village.
<br></p><p>When she came to the mountain stream she crossed it carefully. Nobody held
her hand, and the stream water was very cold. The trail went up again, and she was in
the moonlight shadows among the trees and shrubs. Slowly she climbed the mountain.
<br></p><p>When Lumnay reached the clearing, she could see from where she stood the
blazing bonfire at the edge of the village, where the wedding was. She could hear the
far-off clamor of the gongs, still rich in their sonorousness, echoing from mountain to
mountain. The sound did not mock her; they seemed to call far to her, to speak to her in
the language of unspeaking love. She felt the pull of their gratitude for her
sacrifice. Her heartbeat began to sound to her like many gangsas.
</p><br>
<p></p><p>Lumnay though of Awiyao as the Awiyao she had known long ago-- a strong,
muscular boy carrying his heavy loads of fuel logs down the mountains to his home.
She had met him one day as she was on her way to fill her clay jars with water. He had
stopped at the spring to drink and rest; and she had made him drink the cool mountain
water from her coconut shell. After that it did not take him long to decide to throw his
spear on the stairs of her father's house in token on his desire to marry her.
<br></p><p>The mountain clearing was cold in the freezing moonlight. The wind began to
stir the leaves of the bean plants. Lumnay looked for a big rock on which to sit down.
The bean plants now surrounded her, and she was lost among them.
<br></p><p>A few more weeks, a few more months, a few more harvests---what did it
matter? She would be holding the bean flowers, soft in the texture, silken almost, but
moist where the dew got into them, silver to look at, silver on the light blue, blooming
whiteness, when the morning comes. The stretching of the bean pods full length from
the hearts of the wilting petals would go on.
60Lumnay's fingers moved a long, long time among the growing bean pods.

<p><center><strong>The Bread of Salt<br>
by NVM Gonzalez (1958)</strong></p></center>

<p>Usually I was in bed by ten and up by five and thus was ready for one more
day of my fourteenth year. Unless Grandmother had forgotten, the fifteen
centavos for the baker down Progreso Street - and how I enjoyed jingling
those coins in my pocket!- would be in the empty fruit jar in the cupboard. I
would remember then that rolls were what Grandmother wanted because
recently she had lost three molars. For young people like my cousins and myself,
she had always said that the kind called pan de salought to be quite all right.
<br></p><p>
The bread of salt! How did it get that name? From where did its flavor come,
through what secret action of flour and yeast? At the risk of being jostled from the
counter by early buyers, I would push my way into the shop so that I might watch
the men who, stripped to the waist, worked their long flat wooden spades in and
out of the glowing maw of the oven. Why did the bread come nut-brown and the
size of my little fist? And why did it have a pair of lips convulsed into a painful
frown? In the half light of the street, and hurrying, the paper bag pressed to my
chest, I felt my curiosity a little gratified by the oven-fresh warmth of the bread I
was proudly bringing home for breakfast.
</p>
<br><img src="img/21image.jpg" width="300">
 	<p>Well I knew how Grandmother would not mind if I nibbled away at one piece;
perhaps, I might even eat two, to be charged later against my share at the table.
But that would be betraying a trust; and so, indeed, I kept my purchase intact. To
guard it from harm, I watched my steps and avoided the dark street corners.
<br></p><p>
For my reward, I had only to look in the direction of the sea wall and the fifty
yards or so of riverbed beyond it, where an old Spaniard's house stood. At low
tide, when the bed was dry and the rocks glinted with broken bottles, the stone
fence of the Spaniard's compound set off the house as if it were a castle. Sunrise
brought a wash of silver upon the roofs of the laundry and garden sheds which
had been built low and close to the fence. On dull mornings the light dripped from
Do you have any idea what bread is the

the bamboo screen which covered the veranda and hung some four or five yards
from the ground. Unless it was August, when the damp, northeast monsoon had
to be kept away from the rooms, three servants raised the screen promptly at
six-thirty until it was completely hidden under the veranda eaves. From the sound
of the pulleys, I knew it was time to set out for school.
<br></p><p>
It was in his service, as a coconut plantation overseer, that Grandfather had
spent the last thirty years of his life. Grandmother had been widowed three years
now. I often wondered whether I was being depended upon to spend the years
ahead in the service of this great house.

<br>

</p>
<br><img src="img/22image.jpg" width="300">
 	<p>One day I learned that Aida, a
classmate in high school, was the old Spaniard's niece. All my doubts
disappeared. It was as if, before his death, Grandfather had spoken to me about
her, concealing the seriousness of the matter by putting it over as a joke. If now I
kept true to the virtues, she would step out of her bedroom ostensibly to say
Good Morning to her uncle. Her real purpose, I knew, was to reveal thus her
assent to my desire.
<br></p><p>On quiet mornings I imagined the patter of her shoes upon the wooden veranda
floor as a further sign, and I would hurry off to school, taking the route she had
fixed for me past the post office, the town plaza and the church, the health center
east of the plaza, and at last the school grounds. I asked myself whether I would
try to walk with her and decided it would be the height of rudeness. Enough that
in her blue skirt and white middy she would be half a block ahead and, from that
distance, perhaps throw a glance in my direction, to bestow upon my heart a
deserved and abundant blessing. I believed it was but right that, in some such
way as this, her mission in my life was disguised.
<br></p><p>Her name, I was to learn many years later, was a convenient mnemonic for the
qualities to which argument might aspire. But in those days it was a living voice.
"Oh that you might be worthy of uttering me," it said. And how I endeavored to
build my body so that I might live long to honor her. With every victory at singles
at the handball court the game was then the craze at school -- I could feel my
body glow in the sun as though it had instantly been cast in bronze. I guarded my
mind and did not let my wits go astray. In class I would not allow a lesson to pass
unmastered. Our English teacher could put no question before us that did not
have a ready answer in my head. One day he read Robert Louis Stevenson's
The Sire de Maletroit's Door, and we were so enthralled that our breaths
trembled. I knew then that somewhere, sometime in the not too improbable
future, a benign old man with a lantern in his hand would also detain me in a
secret room, and there daybreak would find me thrilled by the sudden certainty
that I had won Aida's hand.

</p>
<br><img src="img/23image.jpg" width="300">
 	<p>It was perhaps on my violin that her name wrought such a tender spell. Maestro
Antonino remarked the dexterity of my stubby fingers. Quickly I raced through
Alard-until I had all but committed two thirds of the book to memory. My short,
brown arm learned at last to draw the bow with grace. Sometimes, when
practising my scales in the early evening, I wondered if the sea wind carrying the
straggling notes across the pebbled river did not transform them into Schubert's
"Serenade."
<br></p><p>At last Mr. Custodio, who was in charge of our school orchestra, became aware
of my progress. He moved me from second to first violin. During the
Thanksgiving Day program he bade me render a number, complete with pizzicati
and harmonics.<br></p><p>
"Another Vallejo! Our own Albert Spalding!" I heard from the front row.<br></p><p>
Aida, I thought, would be in the audience. I looked around quickly but could not
see her. As I retired to my place in the orchestra I heard Pete Saez, the
trombone player, call my name.
<br></p><p>"You must join my band," he said. "Look, we'll have many engagements soon.
It'llbe vacation time."
<br></p><p>Pete pressed my arm. He had for some time now been asking me to join the
Minviluz Orchestra, his private band. All I had been able to tell him was that I had
my schoolwork to mind. He was twenty-two. I was perhaps too young to be going
around with him. He earned his school fees and supported his mother hiring out
his band at least three or four times a month. He now said:
<br></p><p>"Tomorrow we play at the funeral of a Chinese-four to six in the afternoon; in
theevening, judge Roldan's silver wedding anniversary; Sunday, the municipal
dance."
<br></p><p>My head began to whirl. On the stage, in front of us, the principal had begun a
speech about America. Nothing he could say about the Pilgrim Fathers and the
American custom of feasting on turkey seemed interesting. I thought of the
money I would earn. For several days now I had but one wish, to buy a box of
linen stationery. At night when the house was quiet I would fill the sheets with
words that would tell Aida how much I adored her. One of these mornings,
perhaps before school closed for the holidays, I would borrow her algebra book
and there, upon a good pageful of equations, there I would slip my message,
tenderly pressing the leaves of the book. She would perhaps never write back.
Neither by post nor by hand would a reply reach me. But no matter; it would be a
silence full of voices.
</p>

<br>
 	<p>That night I dreamed I had returned from a tour of the world's music centers;
the newspapers of Manila had been generous with praise. I saw my picture on the
cover of a magazine. A writer had described how, many years ago, I used to
trudge the streets of Buenavista with my violin in a battered black cardboard
case. In New York, he reported, a millionaire had offered me a Stradivarius violin,
with a card that bore the inscription: "In admiration of a genius your own people
must surely be proud of." I dreamed I spent a weekend at the millionaire's
country house by the Hudson. A young girl in a blue skirt and white middy
clapped her lily-white hands and, her voice trembling, cried "Bravo!"
What people now observed at home was the diligence with which I attended to
my violin lessons. My aunt, who had come from the farm to join her children for
the holidays, brought with her a maidservant, and to the poor girl was given the
chore of taking the money to the baker's for rolls and pan de sal. I realized at
once that it would be no longer becoming on my part to make these morning trips
to the baker's. I could not thank my aunt enough.
<br></p><p>I began to chafe on being given other errands. Suspecting my violin to be the
excuse, my aunt remarked:"What do you want to be a musician for? At parties,
musicians always eat last."
<br></p><p>Perhaps, I said to myself, she was thinking of a pack of dogs scrambling for
scraps tossed over the fence by some careless kitchen maid. She was the sort
you could depend on to say such vulgar things. For that reason, I thought, she
ought not to be taken seriously at all.
<br></p><p>But the remark hurt me. Although Grandmother had counseled me kindly to
mind my work at school, I went again and again to Pete Saez's house for rehearsals.
20She had demanded that I deposit with her my earnings; I had felt too weak to
refuse. Secretly, I counted the money and decided not to ask for it until I had
enough with which to buy a brooch. Why this time I wanted to give Aida a brooch,
I didn't know. But I had set my heart on it. I searched the downtown shops. The
Chinese clerks, seeing me so young, were annoyed when I inquired about prices.<br> </p>
<img src="img/24image.jpg" width="300"><p>
At last the Christmas season began. I had not counted on Aida's leaving home,
and remembering that her parents lived in Badajoz, my torment was almost
unbearable. Not once had I tried to tell her of my love. My letters had remained
unwritten, and the algebra book unborrowed. There was still the brooch to find,
but I could not decide on the sort of brooch I really wanted. And the money, in
any case, was in Grandmother's purse, which smelled of "Tiger Balm." I grew
somewhat feverish as our class Christmas program drew near. Finally it came; it
was a warm December afternoon. I decided to leave the room when our English
teacher announced that members of the class might exchange gifts. I felt
fortunate; Pete was at the door, beckoning to me. We walked out to the porch
where, Pete said, he would tell me a secret.
</p>
<br>
<p>It was about an as alto the next Sunday which the Buenavista Women's Club
wished to give Don Esteban's daughters, Josefina and Alicia, who were arriving
on the morning steamer from Manila. The spinsters were much loved by the
ladies. Years ago, when they were younger, these ladies studied solfeggio with
Josefina and the piano and harp with Alicia. As Pete told me all this, his lips
ash-gray from practicing all morning on his trombone, I saw in my mind the
sisters in their silk dresses, shuffling off to church for the evening benediction.
They were very devout, and the Buenavista ladies admired that. I had almost
forgotten that they were twins and, despite their age, often dressed alike. In
low-bosomed voile bodices and white summer hats, I remembered, the pair had
attended Grandfather's funeral, at old Don Esteban's behest. I wondered how
successful they had been in Manila during the past three years in the matter of
finding suitable husbands.
<br></p><p>"This party will be a complete surprise," Pete said, looking around the porch as
ifto swear me to secrecy. "They've hired our band."
<br></p><p>I joined my classmates in the room, greeting everyone with a Merry Christmas
jollier than that of the others. When I saw Aida in one corner unwrapping
something two girls had given her, I found the boldness to greet her also.
<br></p><p>"Merry Christmas," I said in English, as a hairbrush and a powder case
emerged from the fancy wrapping. It seemed to me rather apt that such gifts went to
her. Already several girls were gathered around Aida. Their eyes glowed with envy, it
seemed to me, for those fair cheeks and the bobbed dark-brown hair which
lineage had denied them.
<br></p><p>I was too dumbstruck by my own meanness to hear exactly what Aida said in
answer to my greeting. But I recovered shortly and asked:
"Will you be away during the vacation?"
<br></p><p>"No, I'll be staying here," she said. When she added that her cousins were
arriving and that a big party in their honor was being planned, I remarked:"So you know
all about it?" I felt I had to explain that the party was meant to be a
surprise, an asalto.
<br></p><p>And now it would be nothing of the kind, really. The women's club matrons
would hustle about, disguising their scurrying around for cakes and candies as for some
baptismal party or other. In the end, the Rivas sisters would outdo them. Boxes
of meringues, bonbons, ladyfingers, and cinnamon buns that only the Swiss
bakers in Manila could make were perhaps coming on the boat with them. I
imagined a table glimmering with long-stemmed punch glasses; enthroned in that
array would be a huge brick-red bowl of gleaming china with golden flowers
around the brim. The local matrons, however hard they tried, however sincere
their efforts, were bound to fail in their aspiration to rise to the level of Don
Esteban's daughters. Perhaps, I thought, Aida knew all this. And that I should share in a foreknowledge of the matrons' hopes was a matter beyond love. Aida
and I could laugh together with the gods.

</p>

<br><img src="img/25image.jpg" width="300">
<p>At seven, on the appointed evening, our small band gathered quietly at the gate
of Don Esteban's house, and when the ladies arrived in their heavy shawls and
trimpanuelo, twittering with excitement, we were commanded to play the Poet
and Peasant overture. As Pete directed the band, his eyes glowed with pride for
his having been part of the big event. The multicolored lights that the old
Spaniard's gardeners had strung along the vine-covered fence were switched on,
and the women remarked that Don Esteban's daughters might have made some
preparations after all. Pete hid his face from the glare. If the women felt let down,
they did not show it.
<br></p><p>The overture shuffled along to its climax while five men in white shirts bore
huge boxes of goods into the house. I recognized one of the bakers in spite of the
uniform. A chorus of confused greetings, and the women trooped into the house;
and before we had settled in the sala to play "A Basket of Roses," the heavy
damask curtains at the far end of the room were drawn and a long table richly
spread was revealed under the chandeliers. I remembered that, in our haste to
be on hand for the asalto, Pete and I had discouraged the members of the band
from taking their suppers.
<br></p><p>"You've done us a great honor!" Josefina, the more buxom of the twins, greeted
the ladies. "Oh, but you have not allowed us to take you by surprise!" the ladies
demurred in a chorus.
<br></p><p>There were sighs and further protestations amid a rustle of skirts and the glitter
of earrings. I saw Aida in a long, flowing white gown and wearing an arch of
sampaguita flowers on her hair. At her command, two servants brought out a
gleaming harp from the music room. Only the slightest scraping could be heard
because the servants were barefoot. As Aida directed them to place the
instrument near the seats we occupied, my heart leaped to my throat. Soon she
was lost among the guests, and we played "The Dance of the Glowworms." I
kept my eyes closed and held for as long as I could her radiant figure before me.
<br></p><p>Alicia played on the harp and then, in answer to the deafening applause, she
offered an encore. Josefina sang afterward. Her voice, though a little husky,
fetched enormous sighs. For her encore, she gave "The Last Rose of Summer";
and the song brought back snatches of the years gone by. Memories of solfeggio
lessons eddied about us, as if there were rustling leaves scattered all over the
hall. Don Esteban appeared. Earlier, he had greeted the crowd handsomely,
twisting his mustache to hide a natural shyness before talkative women. He
stayed long enough to listen to the harp again, whispering in his rapture:
What do you think was in the mind of the
character-narrator at the moment? What are his
feelings about the upcoming events?

<img src="img/26image.jpg" width="300"><p>By midnight, the merrymaking lagged. We played while the party gathered
around the great table at the end of the sala. My mind traveled across the seas to
the distant cities I had dreamed about. The sisters sailed among the ladies like
two great white liners amid a fleet of tugboats in a bay. Someone had
thoughtfully remembered-and at last Pete Saez signaled to us to put our
instruments away. We walked in single file across the hall, led by one of the
barefoot servants.
<br></p><p>Behind us a couple of hoarse sopranos sang "La Paloma" to the
accompaniment of the harp, but I did not care to find out who they were. The sight of so
much silver and china confused me. There was more food before us than I had ever
imagined. I searched in my mind for the names of the dishes; but my ignorance
appalled me. I wondered what had happened to the boxes of food that the
Buenavista ladies had sent up earlier. In a silver bowl was something, I
discovered, that appeared like whole egg yolks that had been dipped in honey
and peppermint. The seven of us in the orchestra were all of one mind about the
feast; and so, confident that I was with friends, I allowed my covetousness to
have its sway and not only stuffed my mouth with this and that confection but
also wrapped up a quantity of those egg-yolk things in several sheets of napkin
paper. None of my companions had thought of doing the same, and it was with
some pride that I slipped the packet under my shirt. There, I knew, it would not
bulge.
<br></p><p>"Have you eaten?"
<br></p>
<img src="img/27image.jpg" width="300"><p>I turned around. It was Aida. My bow tie seemed to tighten around my collar. I
mumbled something, I did not know what.

added.
<br></p><p>I brought a handkerchief to my mouth. I might have honored her solicitude

<br></p><p>I walked away to the nearest door, praying that the damask curtains might hide me in my shame. The door gave on to the veranda, where once my love had trod
on sunbeams. Outside it was dark, and a faint wind was singing in the harbor.
<br></p><p>With the napkin balled up in my hand, I flung out my arm to scatter the egg-yolk
things in the dark. I waited for the soft sound of their fall on the garden-shed roof.
Instead, I heard a spatter in the rising night-tide beyond the stone fence. Farther
away glimmered the light from Grandmother's window, calling me home.
<br></p><p>But the party broke up at one or thereabouts. We walked away with our
instruments after the matrons were done with their interminable good-byes.
Then, to the tune of "Joy to the World," we pulled the Progreso Street
shopkeepers out of their beds. The Chinese merchants were especially
generous. When Pete divided our collection under a street lamp, there was
already a little glow of daybreak.
<br></p><p>He walked with me part of the way home. We stopped at the baker's when I
told him that I wanted to buy with my own money some bread to eat on the way to
Grandmother's house at the edge of the sea wall. He laughed, thinking it strange
that I should be hungry. We found ourselves alone at the counter; and we
watched the bakery assistants at work until our bodies grew warm from the oven
across the door. It was not quite five, and the bread was not yet ready.

<p><strong>The Baby in the Bottle<br>
by Benjamin Bautista</strong>
</b></p>
<p>The truth was, Mr. Libre felt sorry for his wife. He was very careful to hide it from
her, of course, but day by day, through the years, as he saw her watching the shriveled
half-black baby in the bottle, he felt more and more sorry for her. She would touch the
bottle gently, once in a while, and run her hands fondly over the cold glass; inside, the
stiff, skinless body of a four-inch boy now dead for five years, would bob up and down in
the green alcohol. And then sometimes, slowly, to herself, she would smile.
<br>Mr. Libre‘s wife was a plain woman with high cheekbones and a sad mouth, who
was only twenty-nine years old but whose eyes were no longer young. Mr. Libre himself
was thirty-three but graying hair and some thick corded veins on his hands made him
look older. He was a small man and thin, and long hours of bending over receipts had
given him a stooped posture and made him appear even smaller and thinner.
<br>Very often, whenever he could, Mr. Libre would try to walk to his wife to get her
to start talking too, but it became harder and harder for them to find things to talk about.
The talk always turned to the past and how different it might have been if they‘d had
children. Mr. Libre didn‘t want to talk about those things but his wife did, and gradually,
the pauses stretched longer and made them both uneasy. But he was always patient
with her; even if he was tired or irritable he never showed it in any way. By now he had
learned to put up with many good things.
<br>He was married when he was twenty-two and just out of high school. He had
been alone in the city for four months when he met her. She understood his dialect and
they got along well together. At first he wanted to go on to college but when he thought
it over again, he felt that it wasn‘t fair. That would be asking too much from his wife.
<br>They moved into a rented room which the owner said was the ground floor of a
two-story building, but it was just a room actually, with thick cardboard walls to divide it
into smaller rooms. They planned to move out after a few years because they thought
the room would be too small for the children to come, and they hoped to have many
children. But five years passed before they had their first child, and when it was only
four months in the womb, it was prematurely born.
<br>It was a boy but it didn‘t even look like a baby. It had eyes and ears and arms
and its skinless body had been formed, but it was only four inches long and looked cold
and raw as though it was just a piece of peeled flesh that never had life at all. Mr. Libre
felt it to the nurses but his wife asked to keep it and take it home with her; he didn‘t
know why, until the doctor told him that his wife knew that she could never have any
more children. After that neither of them talked about it much and they slipped back to
the routine of everyday living. Still he took it on himself to try to make it easier for her
through the days. 
<br>One afternoon in the last busy week of January, Mr. Libre was looking over some
old files in the Recorder‘s cubicle when all of a sudden he remembered that on that day
the baby in the bottle was five years and seven months old. He thought no more about it
but kept it in the back of his mind to tell his wife that night; she wanted to hear him talk
about the baby. He went on checking the old files but when he was almost finished, his
eyes hurt again and he had to go back to his desk.
<br>Mr. Libre was a clerk in the freight department of an import-export corporation
and all day he had to sit behind a high desk and sort out receipts and record them. At
was not a hard job but it kept him constantly busy because there were so many receipts
and he was so very careful about his work, he seldom found time to leave his desk from
eight-thirty to five o‘clock every day.
<br>He had been with the firm for nine years now and he knew his work well but still
did not find it easy. It demanded so much concentration from him and there were days
when it all seemed to be painfully hard but it only made him try even harder. May times
he would have to focus his eyes on the pink, yellow and blue receipts and make an
explicit act of the will to follow the items on them. Usually he would have to strain his
eyes excessively so that often the muscles behind his eye sockets tightened and he
would feel a smarting throb in his eyes. He would stop work at once and close his eyes
as tightly as he could. The he would force a smile until his jaw hurt because, although
that didn‘t ease the pain any, it always held back the tears. Tears always embarrasses
him. They made him feel helpless.
<br>He did not rest his eyes long because there were many late receipts that he had
to go through and he went back to work on them. But after a few minutes he grew
restless with the papers and he wanted to go over to the window and get a breath of air.
But the window was across the room and the assistant manager was talking to a typist
only two or three feet away. He tried to sit still on his high chair. He shut his eyes and
took a deep breath and continued to line up the figures on the record sheet but his
fingers shook and the pencil point broke under his hand. He grew annoyed with himself
for being upset over a little thing like that. He was sure his wife was not having an easy
day either.
<br>Concentration always came hard to Mr. Libre because sometimes in the middle
of the day he would find it impossible to keep his thoughts off the many unrelated little
things that came into his mind. He would catch himself thinking of his wife eating lunch
alone every day or the cardboard walls of their room that seemed to close in on them or
perhaps the dead baby submerged in its bottle of green alcohol. He thought of his wife a
lot but many times he thought of the baby, too.<br><center>
II</center><br>
During the first few months and on to the end of that first year, the bottle had
seemed too small for the baby. It looked as though it needed a glass jar with a lid
instead of that bottle with a wide mouth; it floated limply on the surface and slumped
against the glass sides. But after a while the alcohol seeped through it and hardened it,
and it sank stiffly to the bottom. Then little by little it blackened and shriveled up and it
would neither float nor sink but bobbed up and down in its green world of alcohol and glass. And then the bottle didn‘t seem too small for the baby any more because now the
baby‘s shrunken body was completely confined. The bottle fully contained it.
<br>Mr. Libre fully noticed too that his wife had changed. In the beginning she was no
different at all, although at times she did not fall into brooding. Then slowly for no
apparent reason she grew quiet and kept to herself, and that was when the baby in the
bottle took a strange hold on her. He tried to understand her and be patient with her.
She did not want to be the way she was, he told himself, to live in a small cramped
world of her own, to look at the baby, make up daydreams about it all day, to want to
touch it, hold it in her hands. She could not help any of it, he knew, and he did not stop
her, and day by day he got used to her being that way. But still he felt sorry for her.<br><center>
III</center><br>
The blinds on the west window had been lowered and he knew it was getting
late. He shook himself from his thoughts and worked faster because he wanted to finish
the last batch of receipts for the day. It would hardly make any difference because he
would be back the next day anyhow and there would always be more receipts, but there
were things one should do and finishing the day‘s work was one of them. He took
everything as it came and he found it possible to lose himself in his work. He wished he
could do even more and he felt he owed that much to his wife.
<br>It was almost five-twenty when Mr. Libre got up, locked his papers under his desk
and shuffled out of the office. Almost everyone had gone by then except some of the
typists and a secretary doing overtime. He did not look at them as he went out. He left
quietly and alone.
<br>Out in the street he hoped the crowd would not hold him up for long. Heavy traffic
snarled the afternoon rush and cars and buses and people on the sidewalks hardly
moved at all. On the pedestrian lanes as he waited for the go signal, it became stickily
hot; no wind stirred the inert air, thick with gasoline exhaust fumes. But Mr. Libre did not
mind the heat. As he crossed the street he clenched and unclenched his fists and he
tried to walk as fast as the crowd would let him. He was getting impatient. He wished he
were home that very minute.
<br>He pushed the old narrow door of their room open and sat down on the first chair
he saw. He felt very tired btu the chair was hard and rigid and it did not help him any; it
arched his back. His shoulders felt heavy and he was breathing hard but did not rest
long. His wife was in the other room. He stood up and stretched behind the cardboard
wall.
<br>His wife sat on a cat staring at the baby in the bottle. She sat in half darkness a
few feet away from the table where the bottle was. From where he stood he could see
sharply the hollows of her eyes and thin bloodless lips. Her face was totally without
expression. Hew hands were on her lap and she sat unmoving but when he came in
and she saw him, she turned slowly to him and her face broke out in a clumsy uncertain
smile. It was a slow half-silly smile that twisted the corners of her mouth upwards and
nothing else; her eyes remained sad and empty. He has never seen her that way
before. He was afraid she did not recognize him. 
<br>He could not look at her directly. For a moment he felt it was cruel to watch her.
Instead he turned to the baby in the bottle. The tiny half-black thing was drifting and
circling as always in the green alcohol. But now he saw that the bottle and the alcohol
and the long years had gnawed it and little by little the baby was shredding and peeling
off its flesh. The bottle and the alcohol and the long years had choked and shrunk it and
now were eating it up. All the time, through the years, as the baby bobbed up and down
in its own cramped world, it was slowly being destroyed. And no one could do anything
about it.
<br>Mr. Libre felt helplessly hollow inside; he turned his head and shut his eyes
tightly. He forced a smile until his jaw hurt because although he felt no pain in his eyes
now, he wanted to make sure he could hold back the tears.

<p><strong>Moonlight on Manila Bay<br>
by Fernando M. Maramag (1912)</strong></p>
<p><ol><li> A light, serene, ethereal glory rests<br></li>
<li>Its beams effulgent on each crestling wave;<br></li>
<li> The silver touches of the moonlight wave<br></li>
<li>The deep bare bosom that the breeze molests;<br></li>
<li> While lingering whispers deepen as the wavy crests<br></li>
<li> Roll with weird rhythm, now gay, now gently grave;<br></li>
<li> And floods of lambent light appear the sea to pave-<br></li>
<li> All cast a spell that heeds not time‘s behests.<br></li>
<li> Not always such the scene; the din of fight<br></li>
<li> Has swelled the murmur of the peaceful air;<br></li>
<li> Here East and West have oft displayed their might;<br></li>
<li> Dark battle clouds have dimmed this scene so fair;<br></li>
<li> Here bold Olympia, one historic night,<br></li>
<li> Presaging freedom, claimed a people‘s care.</li><br><br></ol></p><p>
<center><strong>Why Manila Bay is a Tourist Attraction</strong></center><br>
It is considered one of the best natural harbors in Southeast Asia. With a total
coastline of 190 km, the bay extends from the province of Bataan to the north and the
province of Cavite to the south. Scattered along the shores of Bataan and Cavite are a
number of beaches, resorts, foliages and volcanoes.
<br></p><p>The most popular segment of the bay is that part in Manila where Fort Santiago,
the old Spanish fort, still stands. Along the bay is a row of important and historic tourist
destinations and commercial areas, which include the walled-city of Intramuros, the
Cultural Center of the Philippines, Star City, Coconut Palace, the United States
Embassy, Manila Yacht Club, the Philippine Senate, and Manila Ocean Park.
<br></p><p>Recently, a promenade was constructed along the bay beside Roxas Boulevard.
Every day, hundreds of tourists and metro Manila residents come here to jog, stroll
around, bike, skate, listen to music from live acoustic bands, sample the foods from a
row of restaurants and snack areas, or simply watch the breathtaking Manila Bay
sunset.
<br></p><p>Along this 2-km walk are coconut trees, foliage, and park benches. Just a decade
ago, this part of the bay was unlighted, unpaved, and was a popular hangout spot for
thieves, substance-users and pimps. Today, it is well-lighted with a row of huge
kaleidoscopic lamp posts. At nights, it is never without sightseers and lovers taking a
romantic stroll. Another relatively new attraction along the bay is the SM Mall of Asia
(MOA). Further south of Roxas Boulevard and near the coastal road to Cavite stands
the third-largest mall in the world. On its Open Concert Grounds along the bay, MOA
had hosts a number of international events, which include international fireworks
competitions and concerts by Alicia Keys, David Archuleta and Justin Bieber.

This lesson allows you to examine the reasons why we fight. You must aim to:</p>

<br><p>
							1. Discover the reasons why our people participated in several upheavals.<br>
2. Recall and explain the instances when you found yourself in a fight.<br>
3. Decipher the meanings of words by looking for their antonyms.<br>
4. Use word clines in order to show the differences between synonyms.<br>
5. Paraphrase a long poem by turning each stanza into a meaningful sentence.<br>
6. Rewrite paragraphs in order to make them more cohesive.<br>
7. Explain how an individual can generate numerous internal conflicts.<br>
8. List down the main conflicts that your are currently undergoing and mapping out
solutions on how to resolve them.<br>

<p><strong>If You Want to Know What We Are<br>
by Carlos Bulosan
</strong></p>
<p><ol>
<center>I</center><br>
<li>If you want to know what we are who inhabit
forest, mountain, rivershore, who harness
beast, living steel, martial music (that classless
language of the heart), who celebrate labour,
wisdom of the mind, peace of the blood;<br></li></p><p>
<li> If you want to know what we are who become
animate at the rain‘s metallic ring, the stone‘s
accumulated strength, who tremble in the wind‘s
blossoming (that enervates earth‘s potentialities),
who stir just as flowers unfold to the sun;<br></li></p><p>
<li>If you want to know what we are who grow
powerful and deathless in countless counterparts,
each part pregnant with hope, each hope supreme,
each supremacy classless, each classlessness
nourished by unlimited splendor of comradeship;<br></li></p><p>
<li> We are multitudes the world over, millions everywhere;
in violent factories, sordid tenements, crowded cities;
in skies and seas and rivers, in lands everywhere;
our number increase as the wide world revolves
and increases arrogance, hunger disease and death.<br></li></p><p>
<li> We are the men and women reading books, searching
in the pages of history for the lost word, the key
to the mystery of living peace, imperishable joy;
we are factory hands field hands mill hand everywhere,
molding creating building structures, forging ahead,<br></li></p><p>
<li> Reaching for the future, nourished in the heart;
we are doctors scientists chemists discovering,
eliminating disease and hunger and antagonisms;
we are soldiers navy-men citizens guarding
the imperishable will of man to live in grandeur,<br></li></p><p>
<li>We are the living dream of dead men everywhere,
the unquenchable truth that class-memories create
to stagger the infamous world with prophecies
of unlimited happiness - a deathless humanity;
we are the living and the dead men everywhere….<br></li></p><p>
<center>II</center><br></li></p><p>
<li> If you want to know what we are, observe
the bloody club smashing heads, the bayonet
penetrating hallowed breasts, giving no mercy; watch the
bullet crashing upon armorless citizens;
look at the tear-gas choking the weakened lung.<br></li></p><p>
<li> If you want to know what we are, see the lynch
trees blossoming, the hysterical mob rioting;
remember the prisoner beaten by detectives to confess
a crime he did not commit because he was honest,
and who stood alone before a rabid jury of ten men,<br></li></p><p>
<li> And who was sentenced to hang by a judge
whose bourgeois arrogance betrayed the office
he claimed his own; name the marked man,
the violator of secrets; observe the banker,
the gangster, the mobsters who kill and go free;<br></li></p><p>
<li> We are the sufferers who suffer for natural love
of man for man, who commemorate the humanities
of every man; we are the toilers who toil
to make the starved earth a place of abundance
who transform abundance into deathless fragrance.<br></li></p><p>
<li> We are the desires of anonymous men everywhere,
who impregnate the wide earth‘s lustrous wealth
with a gleaming fluorescence; we are the new thoughts
and the new foundations, the new verdure of the mind;
we are the new hope new joy life everywhere.<br></li></p><p>
<li> We are the vision and the star, the quietus of pain;
we are the terminals of inquisition, the hiatuses
of a new crusade; we are the subterranean subways
of suffering; we are the will of dignities;
we are the living testament of a flowering race.<br>
If you want to know what we are –<br>
WE ARE THE REVOLUTION!<br></li></p><p></ol>
